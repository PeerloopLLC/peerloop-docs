# ROUTE SWEEP — visual-presentation sweep of every route

**The living source of truth for [RTMIG-4].** This is a **full visual-presentation
sweep** of the entire app surface, organized by **route group**. The unit of work is a
**route's `.astro` page**, but its scope is the **whole rendered page** — every component
the route mounts, all the way down. The route is the *entry point* for assessing the
page's visual presentation; we then do whatever Tier-1 / Tier-2 work that assessment turns up.

> **This supersedes the Conv-290 "porting backlog" framing.** Porting is no longer the
> organizing idea — it's just one kind of work a route might need. **Every route is in the
> sweep, including the ones that already look done.** "Ported" vs "unported" is an
> informational column, not a filter. The done-state is **Swept** (assessed + any visual
> work applied + confirmed), not "ported".

## ⛔ Working protocol — the per-route sweep process (canonical; do NOT skip or hurry)

This is the authoritative, multi-conv-resumable process. **Exhaustive assessment is valued
very highly — we are NOT hurrying.** Every route gets a *complete* Tier-1 AND Tier-2
assessment. A new conversation resumes by reading this section + the route checklist below +
the [Tier-2 ledger](tier2-primitive-ledger.md) + any `.scratch/prim-candidates-*.md` reports.

For **each** route, in order:

1. **Assess Tier-1 (visual / token consistency) — exhaustive.** Open the route's `.astro`
   and **walk its entire component tree** (every island + primitive it mounts, all the way
   down — subcomponents are part of the route). Judge: Matt shell/layout conformance
   (e.g. ListingShell for listings), Matt tokens (flag every legacy `primary-*`/`secondary-*`/
   `rounded-lg`/`text-sm`/`dark:` survivor), SubNav correctness, 404-honesty, and whether it
   reuses existing vetted primitives.
   **Cross-cutting Tier-1 concerns** (shared-infra token nits / hard-coded values repeated
   across components — a placeholder hex, a primitive's hard-coded color, a bare-scale utility)
   are logged in the **[cross-cutting Tier-1 token register](tier2-primitive-ledger.md#cross-cutting-tier-1-token-register-rule-of-three-sop)**
   with a **Rule-of-Three** verdict: **≥3 distinct sites ⇒ Fix** (consolidate now, at whatever
   route it ripened on); **<3 ⇒ Watch**. **Logged either way** — that's the SOP. (Same
   Rule-of-Three discipline the Tier-2 ledger applies to primitives, here applied to
   token/styling concerns. First verify the concern is real before counting — e.g. a
   token-backed utility that only *looks* legacy is not a violation.)
2. **Assess Tier-2 (primitive extraction) — complete, via the ledger.** Run
   `/w-prim-candidates` on the route's key components (the sensor walks the import graph).
   **Log EVERY STRONG candidate in the [Tier-2 ledger](tier2-primitive-ledger.md)** — route ·
   site · instance count · status · impact — *including one-offs* (we record the need + assess
   impact even when Rule-of-Three isn't met). This is the complete Tier-2 pass; nothing is
   skipped, only deferred-with-a-record.
3. **Surface** — present the full Tier-1 + Tier-2 assessment: what the route has, the Tier-1
   work it needs, and every Tier-2 candidate with its impact + a recommended extract-now /
   watch disposition.
4. **Pause for refinements** — **STOP and wait.** The user may add, remove, or reframe scope.
   **Do not edit code before this checkpoint clears.**
5. **Do the work** — apply agreed Tier-1 fixes + the *ripe* Tier-2 extractions (register new
   primitives in `matt-inspired-registry.ts` + `data-prov` stamp; update the ledger row to
   🟢 Extracted). Un-ripe candidates stay logged. Likewise apply any **Rule-of-Three-triggered
   cross-cutting Tier-1 fixes** from the [register](tier2-primitive-ledger.md#cross-cutting-tier-1-token-register-rule-of-three-sop)
   (≥3 sites — consolidate every known site, not just this route's); <3-site concerns stay
   logged as Watch.
6. **Browser-verify** — run the gate (`tsc` / `astro check` / `lint` / `prov:sweep`), then
   **view the route in-browser** across relevant states (member + visitor + any conditional
   cards/empty/error). DOM-verify (`getComputedStyle`/`getBoundingClientRect`) where precision
   matters — gates don't catch CSS (see the `bg-primary`→`bg-text-primary` Conv-291 lesson).
7. **User out-of-scope review (final step — user-driven).** The user inspects the rendered
   page and decides whether anything they saw should be fixed but falls **outside Tier-1/Tier-2
   scope**. If so, **create a dedicated per-route task** (`[<ROUTE>-FIXES]`) and record the
   user's list there. **CAPTURE, do NOT solution or fix** — these are noted for *eventually*,
   when that route's task is worked; do not discuss them to resolution or act on them now.
   **Store CC's research/analysis inline with each item** (the user welcomes comments — e.g.
   root-cause, affected components, design options). The task is a **living per-route list**:
   it grows over time and is **consulted as the sweep proceeds** (a fix noted on one route may
   inform another). If nothing out-of-scope, skip.
8. **Mark Swept** — tick the route row ☑ in the checklist below + note what landed. **Swept =
   Tier-1 done + Tier-2 fully assessed (ripe extracted, rest logged in the ledger) +
   browser-verified + the user's out-of-scope review done** — plus, **for in-scope routes**,
   **style-guide conformance**: every component the route renders is ☑ on Type / Spacing /
   Colour in the [conformance ledger](../typo-fdn/migration-ledger.md) (see § Style-guide
   conformance below for the in/out scope). Un-ripe ledger candidates do NOT block Swept;
   **out-of-scope routes skip the conformance gate** (structural Tier-1/Tier-2 only).

A group task closes when **every** route row under it is ticked Swept.

## Tier-1 / Tier-2 — kinds of work, assessed per route (per `docs/decisions/11-new-routing.md:442`)

Tier is **not** a grouping axis and **not** a per-page phase decided up front — it's a
classification applied **at assessment time** for whatever a given route needs:

- **Tier-1 (do now):** Matt shell + SubNavbar + tokens + swap to *existing* vetted
  primitives + 404-honest routing.
- **Tier-2 (extract):** extract *new* primitives / extend existing ones — evidence-driven,
  Rule-of-Three. Done in-line for the route when the assessment calls for it (no longer a
  single deferred cross-cutting pass; that Conv-219 framing is relaxed for the sweep).

**Cross-route candidates accumulate in the [Tier-2 Primitive Candidate Ledger](tier2-primitive-ledger.md).**
Each route's `/w-prim-candidates` run logs its STRONG candidates there with their site +
instance count, so a cross-cutting primitive (FilterTabs, shared cards, …) gets extracted at
whatever route completes its Rule-of-Three — and one-offs stay visible for impact assessment
even when we're not yet acting. A route can be marked **Swept** with un-ripe Tier-2 candidates
still logged (Swept = Tier-1 done + assessed + *ripe* primitives extracted), not exhausted.

## Style-guide conformance — the 4th "Swept" gate (DECIDED Conv 299)

Beyond Tier-1 (shell/tokens/primitives) and Tier-2 (primitive extraction), an in-scope
route's components must **conform to the style guide on three axes** before the route is Swept.
The route sweep *applies* this layer — the foundations (tokens + discipline) are already built
by **PALETTE-FDN** (colour) and **TYPO-FDN** (type/spacing); the **per-route application rides
this sweep**, exactly as PALETTE-FDN's per-route colour migration already does.

| Axis | Conform to | Foundation |
|------|-----------|-----------|
| **Type** (incl. line-height) | §09 `text-body-*` / `text-hN` role tokens — no `text-[Npx]`, no Tailwind `text-xs/sm/…`, no ad-hoc `leading-*` / raw `font-*` | TYPO-FDN · `docs/as-designed/matt-design-system/09-typography.md` |
| **Spacing** | Matt px scale classes (`p-16`, `gap-12`, `mt-4`) — no arbitrary `[Npx]` for margin/padding/gap; off-scale snaps or is flagged | TYPO-FDN · `[SPACING-4PX-SWEEP]` |
| **Colour** | role tokens (`neutral-*`, `brand-*`, status hues) — map-or-flag; no raw `text-slate-*`/hex | PALETTE-FDN · `docs/as-designed/matt-design-system/05-color-and-tokens.md` |

(Home feed cards additionally conform to the **Unified Feed-Card Spec**, style-guide §9.4a.)
Line-height is **not** a separate axis — the `text-body-*` tokens bundle size+weight+line-height,
so the Type gate covers it.

**The checklist is the [conformance ledger](../typo-fdn/migration-ledger.md)** (component-SoT,
per-axis ☐/☑, route-completion derived): a route is conformance-complete ⟺ every component it
renders is ☑ on all three axes. **Built-in from the start** on routes swept from here on;
**backfilled** on the two already-Swept routes (`/`, `/courses` — started Conv 298, 3/23).

### Conformance scope — which groups get the gate (DECIDED Conv 299)

The gate is **not** app-wide — only user-facing surfaces that matter now. Out-of-scope routes
still get the **structural** Tier-1/Tier-2 sweep; they skip the type/spacing/colour pass.

| | Groups |
|---|---|
| **IN — conformance rides the sweep** | RG-HOME, RG-COURSES *(both backfill)*, RG-COMMS, RG-DISCOVER, RG-MESSAGES, RG-NOTIFS, RG-PROFILE, RG-SESSIONS, RG-PUBPROF, **RG-MOD** (hangs off `Sidebar.tsx`), **RG-WORKSPACES** (IN despite the ⛔ client block), **RG-AUTH** |
| **OUT now — structural sweep only** | `/old/*` (deletion-bound, not a group), **RG-ADMIN** (`/admin/*`, internal), **RG-PUBLIC** (15 marketing pages — redesign-likely) |

Excludes ~31 routes (admin 16 + public 15) + all `/old/*`. **Revisit** RG-PUBLIC if the
marketing redesign lands; **revisit** RG-ADMIN if the admin surface gets a design pass.

**`@matt-source` primitives ARE in conformance scope (DECIDED Conv 300, hybrid):** tokenize where
a role token is exactly equivalent; keep token-less specs as recorded exceptions. Shared primitives
(`SocialPost`, `EntityPill`, …) get ledger rows + migrate once. Full policy + exceptions: see the
[conformance ledger § @matt-source policy](../typo-fdn/migration-ledger.md#matt-source-conformance-policy--decided-conv-300).

## Migration policy (Conv 250) — MOVE, don't copy (applies to still-unported rows)

Porting a route **MOVES** the legacy file `/old/X` → `/X`, marks it `@stand-in`, commits
that move as the page's legacy baseline. The `/old` copy is **NOT** retained live.
Reference / rollback = the **preflip worktree** (`peerloop-ref` → `~/projects/Peerloop-preflip`
:4331) + **git history**. `[PREFLIP-WT]` stays alive until **client-vetting complete**.
**Two-step:** (1) **rehost** = `git mv` + `@stand-in` + commit; (2) **Matt port** =
`@stand-in → @matt-inspired` in place, diffing field-by-field against the move-commit
baseline (faithful function+content AND full Matt styling).

## Status legend

| Token | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| ☐ | Not yet swept |
| ☑ | Swept — assessed, visual work applied, confirmed |
| ⬜ | (port state) legacy-only, needs a root port before/with its sweep |
| 🟦 | (port state) at root as `@stand-in`, awaiting Matt port |
| ✅ | (port state) root `@matt` page live — still gets swept |

## RG-HOME — `/` — **[RG-HOME]**

| Swept | Route | File | Notes (assessment + Tier work — filled at work-time) |
|-------|-------|------|------|
| ☑ | `/` | `index.astro` | **SWEPT Conv 291.** Tier-1: adopted `ListingShell` (centered ~640 feed, `hideRightPanel`), fixing the prior left-aligned `max-w-2xl` feed; token-migrated AnnouncementCard + SuggestionCard (legacy→Matt). Tier-2: extracted **DismissButton** primitive (3 sites); remaining candidates in the [ledger](tier2-primitive-ledger.md). Browser-verified (member+visitor). Out-of-scope fixes deferred → **[HOME-FIXES] #34** (card fonts / type-badge / image-width, filters→panel, panel shown+hideable). SmartFeed PERMANENT here (`/feed`/`/feeds` likely retire); FeedActivityCard NOT yet token-migrated. TRIAGE-RESTYLE deleted. **Conv 296 re-align:** SmartFeed legacy block migrated onto the new PALETTE-FDN tokens (`dark:` removed, error red toned); **FeedActivityCard (57 utils, shared across Home/community/course feeds) recolor DEFERRED** to the ReactionButton/IconButton extraction — deterministic mapping logged in the [ledger](tier2-primitive-ledger.md). **Conv 298 [HOME-RPANEL] (closes part of [HOME-FIXES] #34 = panel shown+hideable):** client wanted Home's dead left gutter killed via a right-side light-blue "Coming Soon" panel that pushes the feed left and grows on wide screens → replaced `ListingShell` with a **bespoke two-column layout in `index.astro`** (feed `lg:w-[640px] lg:shrink-0` anchored left + `<aside class="hidden lg:block lg:flex-1">` light-blue `#eff6ff` growing panel, hides `<lg`). ListingShell's flex model (fixed-panel + growing-list) is the inverse of a decorative absorber, so bespoke beat reuse; Home-only RIGHT (the 4 filter pages keep CD-039 LEFT). DOM-verified 1680/900/2560/1440px; growth bounded by AppLayout's 1248px content-card cap (accepted). Committed `86325970`. **Conv 298 [TYPO-FDN] migration:** AnnouncementCard / SuggestionCard / DiscoveryCard brought to the Unified Feed-Card Spec (3/23 ledger rows ☑); FeedActivityCard type/spacing/colour still tracked in [plan/typo-fdn/migration-ledger.md](../typo-fdn/migration-ledger.md). **Conv 299 conformance backfill — Home CODE-COMPLETE, browser-verify PENDING:** all 8 Home components now code-migrated to the 4th-gate (Type/Spacing/Colour) — StickySignupBar + FeedPost already conformant (0 edits); CourseAnchor/CommunityAnchor/OnboardingNudgeBanner/ProgressionNudge/SmartFeed (code `24cf8646`) + FeedActivityCard (code `02ba8664`, incl. its deferred colour swap + 3-way source tint course→info + the `p-4`/strip/`w-20`→`w-[80px]` bridge-collapse fixes; reaction-pill geometry kept pending ReactionButton). tsc/lint green. **Conv 300 [HOME-VERIFY] — conformance gate now SATISFIED (8/8 ☑, DOM-truth member Sarah/Amanda + visitor).** Browser-verify found the feed's visible type lived in untouched `@matt-source` sub-primitives → decided the **@matt-source hybrid policy** (tokenize-where-equivalent) + migrated `SocialPost`/`EntityPill`/`IconLabelChip` (code `e8a1167b`, 3 new ledger rows); StickySignupBar verified already-conformant (no edits); `[NAVBAR-LEAK]` confirmed AppNavbar legacy classes don't render on `/`; `[TYPO-CTA-TOKEN]` minted `text-body-{small,default}-bold` (12/14px @600) + migrated AnalyticCount/ReviewsTab (code `ea9cce83`); `[TYPO-PHANTOM]` grep clean (zero phantoms). RG-HOME conformance COMPLETE — modulo 3 recorded @matt-source exceptions ([conformance ledger](../typo-fdn/migration-ledger.md#matt-source-conformance-policy--decided-conv-300)). |

## RG-COURSES — `/courses` + course detail — **[RG-COURSES]**

| Swept | Route | File | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|------|
| ☑ | `/courses` | `courses.astro` | **SWEPT Conv 292.** Catalog grid (`CourseCatalogCard`, DISC-DROP stretched-link). Tier-1/2: route-own surface clean; cross-cutting fixes — `#f1f5f9`→`bg-secondary-100` token (12 sites, RoT), DismissButton adopt in OnboardingNudgeBanner. Step-7 local fixes done: card image `aspect-video`→`aspect-[8/3]` (2/3 height), Level+Length pills→Select dropdowns (CoursesFilters). Browser-verified (member; dropdowns + shorter cards; no console errors). Deferred → **[COURSES-FIXES] #28**: ⟂ responsive/compact filters ([FILTERS-RESPONSIVE]) + ⟂ app-wide typography ([TYPO-REVIEW]). **Conv 296 re-align:** migrated onto the new PALETTE-FDN tokens — `bg-secondary-100`→`bg-neutral-100` ×8 across Course{Progress,Teaching,Created,Moderation}Card + RecommendedCourses skeleton. |
| ☑ | `/course/[slug]/[...tab]` | `course/[slug]/[...tab].astro` | **SWEPT Conv 295.** `@matt-source` hub (8 tabs). Page shell clean Matt; assessed page + all 14 subcomponents. **No per-route fixes** — 4 hard-hex swaps applied then **reverted** after classifying them as Matt primitive-signature / convention values (not strays): `#f6f6f6`+`rgba(88,77,244,.14)` = `AnalyticCount` Default signature; `#1f2937` = shared no-thumbnail fallback. **Precedent set:** classify hard-hex before swapping (primitive→adopt; convention/recurring→tokenize app-wide; only strays→per-route swap). Candidates logged in [ledger](tier2-primitive-ledger.md): AnalyticCount adopt/extend, TagPill, `#f6f6f6` tokenize-at-primitive, no-image-color (`#1f2937` vs `#414141`) reconcile. EnrollButton dropped (already Matt via `PrecheckoutContent variant="matt"`; legacy path is `/old`-only → dead-code after [OLD-PORTED-CLEANUP] #6). Tier-2 sensor: all loop-repeated substrate. Gate green; browser DOM-verified. Step-7 review: nothing out-of-scope. Hero inset-vs-full-bleed still tracked under [LAYOUT-SG]. |
| ☑ | `/course/[slug]/book` | `course/[slug]/book.astro` | `@matt-inspired` (graduated Conv 242). **SWEPT Conv 297.** Tier-1: 30 Tailwind-default colour utils → PALETTE-FDN role tokens (13× `bg-gray-100`→`neutral-100`; red→`error-100/500`; green→`success-100/300`; amber warning family→`warning-100/300/500`; **2× `text-amber-500 ★`→`text-star`** — the map-or-flag catch); 2 stale "honest-orphan" comments retired. No per-route fixes. Tier-2 (🟡 Watch, none ripe): Stepper (:381), teacher SelectableCard (:436), month-nav **IconButton** (:556/570 — app-wide extraction, ledger L42), Calendar/DatePicker (:553–615), time-slot Chip (:648). Verified: tsc/lint clean, zero strays; member DOM-truth (schedule step `bg-neutral-100`→rgb(241,241,241), `text-star`→rgb(245,166,35), all 8 role vars resolve exact); visitor→`/login`. Sensor report: `.scratch/prim-candidates-components-booking-SessionBooking.md`. |
| ➖ | ~~`/course/[slug]/precheckout`~~ | **REMOVED Conv 297** | Subnavbar-experiment remnant (Matt `558:15067`). The content's canonical home is the **`/benefits` SubNav "Enroll" tab** (`[...tab].astro` renders the shared `PrecheckoutContent`); the standalone route was only an alternate host. Deleted `precheckout.astro`; repointed CourseHeader non-enrolled CTA `/precheckout`→`/benefits`. `/precheckout` now **302→`/course/[slug]`** via the catch-all unknown-tab handler (graceful existing behavior, not 404). User decision Conv 297. |
| ☑ | `/course/[slug]/success` | `course/[slug]/success.astro` | **SWEPT Conv 297.** `@matt-source 579:16885`. Page shell + MilestoneComposer already clean Matt. Sweep finding: subcomponent **ExpectationsForm** (one-time post-enroll modal) was unmigrated legacy → **retrofitted** ([EXPECTATIONS-MATT]): adopted FormField + Select + new **Textarea** primitive + Button, mapped red/legacy-ramp → alert/brand role tokens, `@matt-inspired`, behavior preserved (6 fields, ≥20-char validation, POST, skip, char counter). Surfaced + **fixed app-wide** ([ALERT-TUNE]): `--Alert-Default` neon `#FF0038` → `var(--error-300)` `#E11D3F` (23 alert utils / 14 files unified with the Conv-296 error tune). Verified: tsc/lint clean, zero strays; DOM-truth on the live modal (6 FormFields / 4 Selects / 2 Textareas, brand gradient, Save disabled-until-valid, required `*`→#E11D3F). |

Tier-2: purple button → `<Button>` brand-variant → [PROFILE-PRIM-SWEEP]; (5) **SecuritySettings (Security)** ☑ **Conv 303** — full 3-axis restyle (Section + DeleteAccountModal subcomponents), DOM-verified member Amanda Lee + visitor (`/login` redirect): slate→`neutral` + **red danger→`error-*`** (Conv-301 account-chrome precedent: red-600→error-300, red-700/900→error-500, red-50→error-100, red-200→error-300) + type tokens + bare-Matt-numeric spacing. **Tier-2: 2 ripe extractions APPLIED** — loading→`<SkeletonCard>`×4, error→`<ErrorRetryCard>` (both already consumed by sibling StripeConnect); deferred → [PROFILE-PRIM-SWEEP]: red `<Button>` danger variant, modal Cancel→`outlined`, `DeleteAccountModal`→Modal primitive. Test updated (border-red-200→error-300). Gates green (tsc/lint/tailwind/build + 29/29 SecuritySettings.test). **Spacing convention standardized this conv:** bare Matt numerics + off-set normalized (`py-16`/`px-24`, not `[16px]`); StripeConnect (4) retro-fixed to match. **Remaining (1):** `ProfileSettings` (Edit, 740ln — last + heaviest). **Resume point:** `ProfileSettings`. |

## RG-SESSIONS — `/session/[id]` — **[RG-SESSIONS]**

## RG-WORKSPACES — Role workspaces — **[RG-WORKSPACES]** · ⛔ client-blocked (ROLE-STUDIOS)

Shells built `@matt-inspired`. ⛔ **Blocked by client** (old-vs-new dashboard comparison vet)
— sweep these rows once unblocked. Island restyles fold in as rows. `creating/apply` +
[NUDGE-CACHE-FLASH] owned here. SoT: `PLAN.md § ROLE-STUDIOS` (6-phase).

| Swept | Route | File | Notes |

## RG-ADMIN — `/admin/*` — **[RG-ADMIN]** · 🟦 rehosted, island/body-only

**Shell already Matt** (`AdminLayout` + `AdminNavbar`, Conv 193) — pages are thin `.astro`
wrappers mounting an island, so port/sweep is **island/body-only**, shell untouched.
`/api/admin/*` unaffected. 14 are `@stand-in`; `announcements` + `promotion-settings` are
already `@matt-inspired` (still swept).

| Swept | Route | File | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|------|
| ☐ | `/login` | `login.astro` | Promoted to root Conv 201 ([RTMIG-1]). `AutoOpenAuthModal` + `AppLayout`. |

## RG-PUBPROF — Public profiles — **[RG-PUBPROF]** · ⬜ unported · blocked by [ROLE-SEMANTICS]

**Hub-and-spoke.** `/@[handle]` is the universal hub; `PublicProfile` carries
`is_creator`/`is_teacher` (per [ROLE-SEMANTICS]) and renders role teasers linking OUT to the
deep views. All 3 still legacy-only.

| Swept | Route | File | Notes |
|-------|-------|------|------|
| ☐ | `/@[handle]` | `old/@[handle].astro` ⬜ | Universal hub. Preserve `/@me` self-redirect + role teasers. [ENTITY-ANCHOR] plural-slug fix (`/teacher/${handle}` singular) folds here. |
| ☐ | `/teacher/[handle]` | `old/teacher/[handle]/index.astro` ⬜ | Deep teacher view. Adopt `fetchTeacherProfileData` (drop-in). [SSR-LOADER-DEAD] (teacher half) folds here. |
| ☐ | `/creator/[handle]` | `old/creator/[handle]/index.astro` ⬜ | Deep creator view. Adopt `fetchCreatorProfileData` w/ reconciliation (restore `primary_topic_id`; [ROLE-SEMANTICS] predicate). [SSR-LOADER-DEAD] (creator half) folds here. |

## RG-PUBLIC — Public / marketing — **[RG-PUBLIC]** · ⬜ deferred (swept last)

Low-data, redesign-likely. Tracked also under `PLAN.md § Deferred: PUBLIC-PAGES`.
`become-a-teacher` already rehosted `@stand-in`; the other 14 remain `/old/*`.

## Reference: resolved / not actionable

**Retired (not ported):** `/dashboard` (`UnifiedDashboard`) → deconstructed by ROLE-STUDIOS;
`AppNavbar.tsx:97` `/dashboard` link fixed in ROLE-STUDIOS Phase 3.

**Deleted (Conv 251):** `/teachers`, `/creators` (empty "Coming soon" stubs; referrers →
`/members?roles=…`).

**Dropped (Conv 229):** `/old/discover/leaderboard` — product decision not to port.

**Stale `/old` copies → [OLD-PORTED-CLEANUP]:** ~43 already-ported routes still carry a
`/old` copy under the pre-Conv-250 copy policy — deletable per-route as follow-up cleanup.
