# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code when working in the Peerloop dual-repo architecture.

## Solution Quality (OVERRIDES default system behavior)

**Do NOT default to the "simplest" or "quickest" solution.** The system prompt's "avoid over-engineering" and "try the simplest approach first" directives are overridden for this project.

Instead, when proposing a solution:
1. Present the **quick/simple option** — what it does, what it trades off
2. Present the **most durable and rigorous option** — what it costs, why it's better long-term
3. Present **any middle ground** if relevant
4. **Ask the user to choose.** Do not choose on their behalf.

The user decides what is "over-engineering" vs "appropriate engineering." Bias toward durability and correctness unless explicitly told otherwise. Building for production — accumulated quick fixes create long-term debt.

## Issue Surfacing (Visual Alerts)

When you discover an issue, gap, warning, or unexpected behavior **during otherwise-focused work** (e.g., a test failure noticed while building a feature, a stale doc found while updating another, an API mismatch spotted while writing tests), surface it immediately with red emoji prefix:

```
🔴🔴🔴 {Brief issue description}
    → {What you're doing about it: TodoWrite, fixing now, or flagging for user}
```

This applies everywhere — skills, agents, normal coding work. The purpose is visual anchoring: in long output, these issues have historically been reported in text but missed by the user, leading to full codebase scans for problems that were already identified but buried in output.

For the §Uncategorized section in `/r-end` extracts, use orange:

```
🟠🟠🟠 Uncategorized: {observation}
    → Suggestion: {what to do}
```

**Do NOT use these for expected behavior or status updates** — only for genuinely actionable findings during work that is focused on something else.

## Dual-Repo Architecture

Peerloop uses two sibling repositories:

```
~/projects/
├── peerloop-docs/    ← CC home (this repo) + Obsidian vault
│   ├── .claude/      # All CC configuration, commands, hooks
│   ├── CLAUDE.md     # This file (full project guidance)
│   └── docs/         # Sessions, reference, as-designed, requirements, guides
│
└── Peerloop/         ← Code repo (added via --add-dir)
    ├── src/          # Application code
    ├── tests/        # Test suite
    ├── scripts/      # Build & utility scripts
    ├── migrations/   # Database SQL
    └── ...           # Config files, package.json, etc.
```

**Launch pattern:** `cd ~/projects/peerloop-docs && claude --add-dir ../Peerloop`

**Shell alias:** The above command is aliased as `peerloop` in `~/.zshrc`. From any terminal (typically `~/projects/Peerloop`), type `peerloop` to launch the dual-repo environment. This is the standard entry point and must be configured when setting up a new development machine.

**Path conventions:**
- Docs, planning files → local paths (e.g., `docs/reference/...`, `docs/as-designed/...`, `docs/reference/DB-GUIDE.md`)
- Code, tests, scripts, config → prefixed paths (e.g., `../Peerloop/src/...`)
- npm/npx commands → `cd ../Peerloop && npm run ...`

**Symlinks in code repo** (for build-time dependencies):
- `Peerloop/docs → ../peerloop-docs/docs`

---

## Startup Hooks (SessionStart)

**Global hook** (runs for all projects via `~/.claude/settings.json`):

### Machine Detection (`~/.claude/hooks/detect-machine.sh`)
Detects the development machine and displays capabilities/constraints. Writes machine name to `~/.claude/.machine-name` for use by `/r-commit` and `/w-timecard`.

| Machine | D1 Local | D1 Remote | R2 Local | R2 Remote | Notes |
|---------|:--------:|:---------:|:--------:|:---------:|-------|
| MacMiniM4-Pro | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full functionality |
| MacMiniM4 | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Full functionality |

**Project hooks** (Peerloop-specific via `.claude/settings.json`):

- `dual-repo-info.sh` — Shows both repos and their branches
- `check-env.sh` — Validates dev environment (Node, wrangler, etc.)

## Conversation (Conv) Lifecycle

Work units are tracked as **Conv** (Conversation) numbers, replacing the previous Session numbering (which ended at Session 393). Conv numbers start at 001. Both repos are treated as a paired unit — same Conv number in both repos' commit messages.

**Key files:** `CONV-COUNTER` (persistent integer, git-synced), `.conv-current` (ephemeral, gitignored)

### Workflow

| I want to... | Run |
|---|---|
| Start working (any context) | `/r-start` |
| Save & keep working (fresh context) | `/r-end` → `/clear` → `/r-start` |
| Save & keep working (same context) | `/r-commit` |
| Save & quit for the day | `/r-end` → exit |

### Conv Skills (r-* prefix)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/r-start` | **Start conversation** — check repos clean, pull, increment Conv, push, resume (inline) |
| `/r-end` | **End conversation** — collector + 3 parallel agents (learn-decide, update-plan, docs), commit/push |
| `/r-commit` | Commit both repos with Conv + Machine metadata |
| `/r-timecard` | Generate merged dual-repo timecard for client billing |
| `/r-timecard-day` | Generate intelligent daily timecard with auto-grouping and structured tag extraction |
| `/r-prune-claude` | Optimize CLAUDE.md by moving content to offload file |

### Peerloop-Specific Skills (w-* prefix)

| Skill | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `/w-timecard` | Generate single-repo commit timecard for client billing |
| `/w-schema-dump` | Export database table schema to TSV |
| `/w-sync-docs` | Audit docs for drift against codebase |
| `/w-add-client-note` | Process client notes into RFC |
| `/w-codecheck` | Run comprehensive code quality checks |
| `/w-post-fix` | Lightweight end-of-conv for bug-fix conversations |
| `/w-git-history` | Extract commit history |
| `/w-review-resume-state` | Present RESUME-STATE.md for user review |
| `/w-sync-skills` | Scan another dual-repo project for skill changes and port improvements |
| `/w-test-env` | Test env var availability in skill expressions |

## Test Suite Workflow

**CRITICAL: When running the full test suite, follow this workflow:**

1. **Run once and capture failures** to a file:
   ```bash
   cd ../Peerloop && npm test 2>&1 | tee /tmp/test-output.txt
   ```

2. **Extract failing tests** into a structured list:
   ```bash
   grep -E "FAIL.*test\.(ts|tsx)" /tmp/test-output.txt | sort -u > /tmp/failing-tests.txt
   ```

3. **Present results to user** before proceeding:
   - Show the count of failures
   - List the failing test files
   - Wait for user instruction on how to proceed

4. **Fix tests individually**, running only that specific test:
   ```bash
   cd ../Peerloop && npm test -- --testNamePattern="TestName" 2>&1 | tail -15
   ```

5. **Do NOT re-run the full suite** until all identified failures are fixed.

**Why this matters:**
- Full test suite takes ~2 minutes
- Running it repeatedly wastes time and context
- Fixing tests one-by-one with targeted runs is efficient

## Project Overview

**Peerloop** (formerly Alpha Peer) is a peer-to-peer learning platform that solves the "2 Sigma Problem" by making 1-on-1 tutoring affordable and scalable through a learn-teach-earn flywheel.

### The Flywheel Model
- Student enrolls and learns from a Teacher
- Student completes course → Teacher recommends → Creator certifies
- Student becomes Teacher → teaches new students → earns 70% commission
- Cycle repeats, creating self-sustaining teaching capacity

### Key Metrics
| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Course Completion Rate | ≥75% (vs 15-20% MOOC average) |
| Student-to-Teacher Conversion | 10-20% |
| Genesis Cohort | 60-80 students, 4-5 courses |
| Timeline | 4 months |
| Budget | $75,000 |

## Technology Stack

| Layer | Technology | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Meta-framework | Astro.js | React islands, SSG/SSR |
| UI Framework | React.js | Component library |
| Styling | TailwindCSS | Utility-first CSS |
| Hosting/Edge | Cloudflare | Pages, Workers, R2, D1 |
| Database | Cloudflare D1 | SQLite-based |
| Auth | Custom JWT | Session management |
| Payments | Stripe Connect | 85/15 split, payouts |
| Activity Feeds | Stream.io | Feeds only (not chat) |
| Video | VideoProvider Interface | BBB/PlugNmeet abstraction |
| Email | Resend | Transactional email |
| File Storage | Cloudflare R2 | S3-compatible |

### Development Machines

| Name | Machine | D1 Support | R2 Support |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| `MacMiniM4-Pro` | Mac Mini M4 Pro (64GB) | Local + Remote | Local + Remote |
| `MacMiniM4` | Mac Mini M4 (24GB) | Local + Remote | Local + Remote |

Both machines have identical, full capabilities. See `docs/as-designed/devcomputers.md` for details.

## Development Commands

All code commands run from the code repo:

```bash
# Install dependencies
cd ../Peerloop && npm install

# Start development server
cd ../Peerloop && npm run dev

# Dev server with remote staging D1 (for bug reproduction)
cd ../Peerloop && npm run dev:staging

# Build for production
cd ../Peerloop && npm run build

# Preview production build
cd ../Peerloop && npm run preview

# Type checking
cd ../Peerloop && npx tsc --noEmit

# Linting
cd ../Peerloop && npm run lint
```

## SQLite Datetime Rule

**NEVER use `datetime()` in SQL comparisons.** SQLite's `datetime()` returns space-separated format (`2026-03-25 11:00:00`) while Peerloop stores timestamps in ISO format with `T` separator (`2026-03-25T11:00:00.000Z`). String comparison makes `datetime()` results always appear "less than" ISO strings because space (ASCII 32) < T (ASCII 84). This causes silent, hard-to-detect bugs.

**Always use:** `strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ', ...)` for any SQL datetime arithmetic in comparisons.

```sql
-- ❌ WRONG — silent comparison bug
WHERE datetime(s.scheduled_end, '+1 hour') < ?

-- ✅ CORRECT — produces ISO format matching stored timestamps
WHERE strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ', s.scheduled_end, '+1 hour') < ?
```

`datetime()` is safe in non-comparison contexts (e.g., `DEFAULT (datetime('now'))` in schema DDL) but even there, prefer `strftime('%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%fZ', 'now')` for consistency.

This is enforced by `/w-codecheck`.

## Database Migrations

**Migration Strategy:** Split seed files for production safety. See `docs/as-designed/migrations.md`.

```
../Peerloop/migrations/              # PRODUCTION-SAFE (applied everywhere)
├── 0001_schema.sql                  # Table definitions
└── 0002_seed_core.sql               # Essential data (topics, tags, admin, The Commons)

../Peerloop/migrations-dev/          # DEV ONLY (local + staging only)
└── 0001_seed_dev.sql                # Test data (users, courses, etc.)
```

**Commands:**
```bash
# Local production-like (schema + core seed only)
cd ../Peerloop && npm run db:setup:local

# Local dev (+ dev seed data)
cd ../Peerloop && npm run db:setup:local:dev

# Local dev + booking test data
cd ../Peerloop && npm run db:setup:local:booking

# Production (SAFEGUARDED - requires confirmation)
cd ../Peerloop && npm run db:migrate:prod
```

**Blocked Commands (for safety):**
- `npm run db:seed:prod` - Dev seed CANNOT be applied to production
- `npm run db:reset:prod` - Production reset is blocked

**Schema Changes:**
- Edit `../Peerloop/migrations/0001_schema.sql` directly - it's the authoritative schema
- Post-launch: Add incremental `0003_*.sql` migrations for production upgrades

**Testing:**
- Test DB uses better-sqlite3 (works on all machines)
- Applies migrations fresh each run
- `cd ../Peerloop && npm run test` validates schema automatically

### Schema Mismatch During Testing

**CRITICAL: The schema is NOT finalized.** When writing tests, if you encounter ANY discrepancy between:
- Test expectations vs schema
- Endpoint code vs schema
- Non-existent tables/columns referenced in code

**You MUST STOP and ask the user.** Do NOT assume the schema is correct. Do NOT silently fix the endpoint to match the schema.

**Present options to the user:**
```
Schema/Code Discrepancy Detected
────────────────────────────────
Location: [endpoint or test file]
Issue: [describe the mismatch]

Current schema says: [X]
Code/test expects: [Y]

Options:
1. Fix the schema to match the code's design intent
2. Fix the code/test to match current schema
3. Discuss the design intent first
```

**Examples of discrepancies to flag:**
- FK references wrong table (e.g., `REFERENCES users(id)` vs `REFERENCES teacher_certifications(id)`)
- Code references non-existent table or column
- Test expects columns that don't exist
- Column types or constraints don't match usage

**Let the user decide** - the schema is still evolving. Often the code represents the intended design and the schema needs updating.

**If extending schema:** Edit `../Peerloop/migrations/0001_schema.sql` directly, update `../Peerloop/migrations/0002_seed_core.sql` if needed.

### D1 Database Reset

To reset a D1 database and re-apply migrations fresh:

```bash
# Local D1
cd ../Peerloop && npm run db:reset:local && npm run db:migrate:local

# Staging D1 (Cloudflare)
cd ../Peerloop && npm run db:reset:staging && npm run db:migrate:staging

# Production D1 (Cloudflare) - use with caution!
cd ../Peerloop && npm run db:reset:remote && npm run db:migrate:remote
```

**How it works:**
- **Local:** Deletes SQLite files in `../Peerloop/.wrangler/state/v3/d1/` (simplest approach)
- **Remote:** Parses `0001_schema.sql` for FK relationships, drops tables in dependency order (children before parents)

**Why dependency order?** D1 enforces `foreign_keys=ON` at the platform level and doesn't allow `PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF`. Using `PRAGMA defer_foreign_keys=ON` doesn't help with DROP TABLE. The only reliable approach is to drop child tables before parent tables.

**Known issue — remote reset can leave orphaned indexes (Session 359):**
The `reset-d1.js` script drops tables but not standalone indexes. If the batch drop fails partway (e.g., FK constraint error on a circular dependency), surviving tables retain their indexes. When you then drop those tables individually, the indexes become orphaned — they exist in `sqlite_master` but reference no table. On the next `CREATE INDEX` (without `IF NOT EXISTS`), the migration fails with `index already exists`.

**Manual recovery when remote reset leaves orphans:**
```bash
# 1. Check what's left
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --env preview --remote \
  --command "SELECT name, type FROM sqlite_master WHERE type IN ('table','index') AND name NOT LIKE 'sqlite_%' AND name NOT LIKE 'd1_%' AND name NOT LIKE '_cf_%';"

# 2. Drop orphaned indexes (batch — extract names from step 1)
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --env preview --remote \
  --command "DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_name_1; DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_name_2; ..."

# 3. Drop remaining tables in dependency order (children first, 3 batches)
# Batch 1: leaf tables (no children)
# Batch 2: mid-level (sessions, enrollments, etc.)
# Batch 3: parent tables (courses, communities, users)

# 4. Clear migration tracking and re-apply
npx wrangler d1 execute DB --env preview --remote --command "DELETE FROM d1_migrations;"
npm run db:migrate:staging
```

> **Test baseline caveat:** 6 test failures pre-existed this block; 1 new failure surfaced during it. Pre-rename state is not a clean-passing baseline.

### What Are We Building?

| Need | Look In |
|------|---------|
| Project goals & success metrics | `docs/requirements/GOALS.md` |
| User stories (all 370+) | `docs/requirements/USER-STORIES.md` |
| User stories by role | `docs/requirements/stories/stories-*.md` (admin, creator, student, etc.) |
| **Route→story mapping (402 stories)** | `docs/as-designed/route-stories.md` — **Canonical route-to-story assignment** |
| MVP scope (144 P0 stories) | `docs/as-designed/run-001/SCOPE.md` |

### How Should It Look/Work?

| Need | Look In |
|------|---------|
| **Routes & navigation** | `docs/as-designed/url-routing.md` - **Source of truth for routes** |
| Page specs (JSON) | **DELETED** (Sessions 307+311) — see git history |
| Page specs (MD) | **DELETED** (Sessions 307+311) — see git history |
| UI components | `docs/reference/_COMPONENTS.md` |
| Feature breakdown by block | `docs/as-designed/run-001/_features-block-*.md` |
| Original page architecture | `docs/as-designed/orig-pages-map.md` - Pre-Twitter UI pivot reference |

**Note:** The original `PAGES-MAP.md` was renamed to `docs/as-designed/orig-pages-map.md` after the client moved to a Twitter-like UI/UX. Route information is now maintained in `docs/as-designed/url-routing.md`.

### Data & APIs

| Need | Look In |
|------|---------|
| Database schema (SQL source of truth) | `../Peerloop/migrations/0001_schema.sql` |
| Database design rationale | `docs/reference/DB-GUIDE.md` |
| Internal API endpoints | `docs/reference/DB-API.md` |
| External service APIs | `docs/reference/REMOTE-API.md` (Stripe, Stream, PlugNmeet, Resend) |

### Technology Decisions

| Need | Look In |
|------|---------|
| Why we chose a vendor/service | `docs/reference/*.md` (vendor docs merged here) |
| Vendor comparisons | `docs/reference/comp-*.md` |
| Integration patterns | `docs/reference/*.md` (code examples section) |
| Architecture & design patterns | `docs/as-designed/*.md` |
| Skills 2 system & drift tools | `docs/as-designed/skills-system.md` |

### Platform Policies & Decisions

| Need | Look In |
|------|---------|
| Platform behavior policies | `docs/POLICIES.md` — Access control, business rules, user capabilities |
| Architecture & implementation decisions | `docs/DECISIONS.md` |
| Docs-repo conventions | `DOC-DECISIONS.md` |

### Implementation

| Need | Look In |
|------|---------|
| Current & pending work | `PLAN.md` (root) |
| Completed work | `COMPLETED_PLAN.md` (root) |
| Project milestone timeline | `TIMELINE.md` (root) — inflection points, not routine work |
| Block-by-block features | `docs/as-designed/run-001/` (files prefixed with `_features-`) |
| Infrastructure features | `docs/as-designed/run-001/_features-infrastructure.md` |

### Feature Tracking Rule

**Any time a feature is mentioned** — whether in a tech doc, session discussion, RFC, or code comment — it must be added to `PLAN.md`. Where it goes is situational (active block, deferred block, sub-task of an existing block, etc.). If the feature originated from a tech doc, add a cross-reference in the tech doc noting the PLAN block it was added to (e.g., "Tracked in PLAN.md: RATINGS-EXT"). Tech docs describe *how* and *why*; PLAN.md is the single source of truth for *what needs to be done*.

### Client Change Requests (RFCs)

| Need | Look In |
|------|---------|
| **RFC index & status** | `docs/requirements/rfc/INDEX.md` - **Lookup table for all RFCs** |
| Source document | `docs/requirements/rfc/CD-XXX/CD-XXX.md` |
| Actionable checklist | `docs/requirements/rfc/CD-XXX/RFC.md` |

## RFC System

Client-driven change requests are tracked in `docs/requirements/rfc/`.

**Structure:**
```
docs/requirements/rfc/
├── INDEX.md           # Lookup table (status, item counts)
└── CD-XXX/
    ├── CD-XXX.md      # Source: raw client input
    └── RFC.md         # Actionable checklist with checkboxes
```

**Workflow:**
1. Client provides note/directive
2. Run `/q-add-client-note` to analyze and create RFC
3. Check off items in `RFC.md` as implemented
4. Update status in `docs/requirements/rfc/INDEX.md` when complete

**When working on an RFC:**
- Read `docs/requirements/rfc/INDEX.md` to find open RFCs
- Check `docs/requirements/rfc/CD-XXX/RFC.md` for pending items
- Mark checkboxes as completed during implementation

## Technology & Architecture Documentation

**Locations:**
- `docs/reference/` — Reference docs including vendor/service docs (e.g., `stripe.md`, `cloudflare.md`, `API-*.md`, `CLI-*.md`)
- `docs/as-designed/` — Architecture & design docs (e.g., `url-routing.md`, `migrations.md`, `messaging.md`)

### When Working with a Technology

1. **Check the doc first** - Before implementing, read the relevant doc in `docs/reference/` or `docs/as-designed/` for:
   - Why it was chosen (decision rationale)
   - Known caveats or limitations
   - Integration patterns and code examples
   - Pricing considerations

2. **Update the doc** - When you discover:
   - New caveats or gotchas
   - Better integration patterns
   - Version-specific issues
