## Deferred: TESTING

**Focus:** Multi-user testing — E2E Playwright flows, branching workflow integration tests, admin test gaps
**Status:** 📋 PENDING
**Merged Conv 095:** E2E-GAPS + E2E-LIFECYCLE + WORKFLOW-TESTS + ADMIN-REVIEW.TESTING

### TESTING.E2E — Playwright Multi-User Flows

*Two-browser Playwright tests for flows not coverable by integration tests*

- [ ] Session invite: Teacher sends → Student accepts → Session created → Both in room
- [ ] Session invite variants: reschedule, expired, decline
- [ ] Booking wizard: teacher select → date → time → confirm → session room
- [ ] Booking reschedule: cancel old → pick new time
- [ ] Session lifecycle: join → video room → completion → rating (two-browser)
- [ ] Notifications: User A action → User B notification badge + page update
- [ ] Messages: User A sends → User B conversation + badge update

### TESTING.WORKFLOW — Branching Integration Tests

*Multi-step flows with decision-point variants. Shared setup → branch at decision point → verify different downstream state.*

| Workflow | Branches | Value |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Booking→Session→Completion** | book, join/no-show, complete (single/final), cancel (on-time/late), reschedule (under/at limit) | Highest — most user-facing |
| **Completion→Cert→Teacher** | rate/skip, recommend/decline, certify/reject, first booking as Teacher (full flywheel) | High — core product thesis |
| **Payment** | checkout success/abandon, refund, dispute open/close (won/lost), payout fail | Medium — webhook chains |
| **Messaging** | start convo (allowed/403), send after relationship ends, admin bypass | Medium — relationship gates |

Existing partial coverage: `tests/api/sessions/`, `tests/api/webhooks/stripe.ts`, `tests/lib/messaging.test.ts`, `tests/integration/message-lifecycle.test.ts`, `tests/integration/notification-lifecycle.test.ts`

### TESTING.ADMIN — Admin Test Gaps

*From Conv 080 audit. 81 of 96 admin components/APIs tested (~1900 tests).*

**Category 1 — Decision Data (12 untested GET `[id].ts` endpoints):**
admin/enrollments, teachers, certificates, courses, sessions, users, payouts, topics, moderation, intel/courses, intel/dashboard, intel/communities. Highly templatable — same auth→404→200+shape pattern.

**Category 2 — Action Execution (2 components):**
ModeratorsAdmin (invite/revoke/remove), TopicsAdmin (reorder/CRUD). API tests exist but component→API wiring untested.

**Category 3 — Shared Infrastructure (5 primitives):**
AdminDataTable, AdminDetailPanel, AdminFilterBar, AdminPagination, AdminActionMenu. Tested indirectly. Recommended: test DataTable + DetailPanel directly (highest cascade risk), skip others.

## Active: CALENDAR

**Focus:** Custom multi-view calendar component system serving all platform roles
**Status:** 📋 PENDING
**Session:** 342

**Vision:** A single, versatile custom calendar component that powers every time-based view on the platform — student schedules, S-T availability and sessions, admin oversight, and activity history. Supports year, month, week, and day views with role-specific data layers, filtering, and clickable items. Built custom (not wrapping a library) to fully control rendering, interaction, and data integration.

### Current State

The platform has three separate calendar-like UIs, each built independently:

| Component | Views | Limitation |
|---|---|---|
| `AvailabilityCalendar` | Month only | No week/day; cell interaction is availability-specific |
| `SessionBooking` (step 2) | Month only | Date picker only; no time-axis view |
| `AvailabilityQuickView` | Static week dots | Not interactive; summary only |

All other schedule UIs (TeacherUpcomingSessions, SessionHistory, StudentDashboard) are lists or tables with no calendar visualization. `react-big-calendar` is installed but unused.

### CALENDAR.CORE — Base Component Architecture

*The shared calendar engine that all role-specific views build on*

- [ ] `PeerloopCalendar` base component with view modes: Year, Month, Week, Day
- [ ] View switcher UI (toolbar with Year | Month | Week | Day toggle)
- [ ] Navigation controls (prev/next, today button, date range display)
- [ ] Timezone-aware date handling (all views respect user timezone)
- [ ] Slot rendering system — calendar "items" rendered as colored blocks/badges:
  - Items have: title, time range, color/category, click handler, optional icon
  - Week/Day views: time-axis layout (vertical hours, items as positioned blocks)
  - Month view: items as compact badges within day cells
  - Year view: heat-map style (activity density per day)
- [ ] Filter bar — toggle data layers on/off (checkboxes or pills)
- [ ] Click-through — items are clickable, navigate to detail page or open detail modal
- [ ] Responsive: week/day views scroll horizontally on mobile; month/year stack vertically
- [ ] Empty state handling per view mode

**Design principle:** The calendar component knows how to render items in time. It does NOT know what the items are. Each integration passes typed item arrays with colors, labels, and click targets.

### CALENDAR.STUDENT — Student Schedule View

*Replace the flat list on StudentDashboard with a real calendar*

- [ ] Week view (default) showing upcoming sessions across all enrolled courses
- [ ] Day view for detailed single-day schedule
- [ ] Month view for planning ahead
- [ ] Data layers:
  - Booked sessions (color-coded by course)
  - Available booking slots (if enrollment has remaining sessions)
- [ ] Click session → navigate to `/session/:id`
- [ ] Click available slot → navigate to booking flow
- [ ] Integration point: StudentDashboard and/or dedicated `/schedule` page

### CALENDAR.TEACHER — Teacher Schedule View

*Unified Teacher calendar replacing AvailabilityQuickView + TeacherUpcomingSessions*

- [ ] Week view (default) showing sessions + availability on the same time axis
- [ ] Day view for detailed daily schedule
- [ ] Month view (replaces or augments existing AvailabilityCalendar)
- [ ] Data layers (toggleable):
  - Booked sessions (color-coded by course or student)
  - Availability windows (recurring slots as background shading)
  - Availability overrides (blocked time, adjusted hours)
  - Buffer time between sessions (visual gap)
- [ ] Click session → navigate to `/session/:id`
- [ ] Click availability block → edit availability
- [ ] Integration point: TeacherDashboard and/or `/teaching/schedule`

**Note:** The existing AvailabilityCalendar with its multi-select-days-and-set-times interaction may remain as a separate editing UI. The CALENDAR.TEACHER view is for *viewing* the schedule, not editing availability.

### CALENDAR.ADMIN — Admin Oversight Calendar

*Platform-wide activity calendar with extensive filtering*

- [ ] All four views: Year, Month, Week, Day
- [ ] Data layers (toggleable, expect this list to grow):
  - **Sessions:** All platform sessions (booked, completed, cancelled, no-show)
  - **Enrollments:** Enrollment events (new, completed, dropped, refunded)
  - **Community activity:** Townhall feed posts, community feed posts
  - **Course activity:** New courses published, materials updated
  - **User events:** Signups, S-T certifications, creator applications
  - **Payments:** Checkout completions, refunds, disputes, payouts
  - **Notifications:** System notifications sent
- [ ] Filters:
  - By role: Student, S-T, Creator, Admin
  - By course: specific course or all
  - By user: specific user or all
  - By event type: sessions, enrollments, community, payments, etc.
  - By status: active, completed, cancelled, etc.
  - Date range quick-picks: Today, This Week, This Month, This Quarter
- [ ] Click any item → navigate to its detail page (session detail, enrollment detail, user profile, etc.)
- [ ] Year view as activity heat map (GitHub-contribution-style) for spotting trends
- [ ] Export/print view (stretch goal)
- [ ] Integration point: Admin dashboard, possibly `/admin/calendar`

### CALENDAR.MIGRATE — Migrate Existing Calendar UIs

*After core is built, migrate existing custom grids to the new system*

- [ ] Evaluate whether `AvailabilityCalendar` editing interaction can use the new month grid or needs to stay separate
- [ ] Migrate `SessionBooking` date picker step to use new month view
- [ ] Replace `AvailabilityQuickView` with a compact week view from the new system
- [ ] Remove `react-big-calendar` from `package.json` (never used, dead dependency)

### CALENDAR.ICS
*.ics calendar file attachments for session booking emails*

**Current state:** `SessionBookingEmail.tsx` sends booking confirmation with BBB link. No `.ics` (iCalendar) file attached. (Capabilities review Session 359)

- [ ] Generate `.ics` file content for booked sessions (VEVENT with start/end, BBB join URL, attendees)
- [ ] Attach `.ics` to `SessionBookingEmail` and `SessionRescheduledEmail`

### Design Notes

**Data fetching pattern:** Each data layer is an independent API call. The calendar component accepts `items: CalendarItem[]` and the parent page fetches and combines layers based on active filters. This keeps the calendar component pure and testable.

```typescript
// Shared item type all data layers produce
interface CalendarItem {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  start: Date;
  end: Date;
  category: string;       // 'session' | 'enrollment' | 'availability' | 'feed' | ...
  color: string;           // Tailwind color class or hex
  icon?: string;           // Optional icon identifier
  href?: string;           // Click-through URL
  onClick?: () => void;    // Or custom click handler
  metadata?: Record<string, unknown>; // Role-specific extra data
}
```

**Phased delivery:** CORE → STUDENT → TEACHER → ADMIN → MIGRATE. Each phase delivers value independently. The admin calendar (most complex) comes last because it has the most data layers and benefits from patterns established in the simpler views.

**Why custom, not react-big-calendar:** The platform needs cell-level control that libraries don't provide — availability multi-select, heat-map year views, togglable data layers with role-specific filtering, and consistent styling with the existing Tailwind design system. A library would fight us on every customization. Building custom means the calendar grows with the platform.

**Week/Day vs Month are architecturally different:** Month view is a grid of day cells with badges. Week/Day views have a vertical time axis (e.g., 6am-10pm) where items are absolutely positioned blocks based on start/end time. The core component must handle both layout modes.

## Active: DOC-SYNC-STRATEGY

**Focus:** Reduce manual documentation maintenance burden by automating drift detection and identifying which docs should be generated vs hand-written
**Status:** 📋 PENDING
**Session:** 383

**Problem:** Session 383 exposed that docs drift silently from the codebase. The COURSE-PAGE-MERGE (Session 379) changed tab count, retired components, and merged pages — but 5 architecture/reference docs still described the old structure 2+ sessions later. The TEST-COVERAGE.md rebuild found 258 of 318 test files undocumented. These aren't one-off oversights; they're systemic.

**Root causes to examine:**
- Manually-written docs describing generated artifacts (routes, components, test files) go stale because nothing enforces sync
- `/r-docs` covers reference docs but not architecture or research docs
- No CI or hook checks for doc freshness
- Some docs duplicate information that could be derived from code (test inventories, route tables, component lists)

**Questions to answer:**
1. Which docs should be **generated** from code (like route-matrix.mjs already does)?
2. Which docs should remain **hand-written** but have **automated staleness checks**?
3. ~~Should `/r-docs` scope expand, or do we need a separate drift-detection tool?~~ **Answered Session 390:** Created `/w-sync-docs` as dedicated drift-detection skill with 7-point test doc audit + API/CLI audits. Separate from `/r-docs` which handles conv-driven updates.
4. Can we use pre-commit hooks or session-start hooks to flag stale docs?
5. What's the right trade-off between doc completeness and maintenance cost?

**Inputs:**
- Session 383 findings: 5 stale architecture docs, 258 undocumented test files, 3 missing API endpoints
- `route-matrix.mjs` as a working example of generated docs (enhanced Session 384: literal slug normalization; Conv 047: balanced-brace JSX extractor for ternary links, structural param resolver — broken targets 3→1)
- `/r-docs` skill as the current manual doc maintenance tool
- `DOCS-GAPS-381.md` audit approach (scan code, diff against docs)
- Session 384: Fixed 5 broken link targets found by route-matrix scanner (wrong slugs, dead links to unbuilt pages, wrong route patterns)
- Conv 022: Fixed sync-gaps.sh (3 bugs, 93% false positive rate → 0%), added 12 route mappings + 15 `me/*` sub-route mappings, documented 15 truly missing API endpoints. All 225 routes now pass gap detection.

## Deferred: MVP-GOLIVE

**Focus:** Production readiness for all external service providers
**Status:** ⏸️ DEFERRED (until launch decision)
**Last Audited:** Session 223 (2026-02-18)

All code is implemented and tested in dev/preview environments. Go-live requires adding production secrets to Cloudflare, registering endpoints in provider dashboards, and verifying DNS/domain configuration. No code changes expected — this is all infrastructure and configuration.

### Production Readiness Scorecard

| Provider | Code | Dev/Preview | Prod Secrets | Prod Config | Ready? |
|----------|:----:|:-----------:|:------------:|:-----------:|:------:|
| **Stripe** | ✅ | ✅ Staging webhook active | ❌ Deferred | ❌ Prod webhook not registered | 🟡 |
| **Stream.io** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ Not set | ⚠️ Verify feed groups in prod app | 🟡 |
| **Resend** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ Not set | ❌ Domain not verified, DNS not set | 🔴 |
| **BigBlueButton** | ✅ | ✅ Blindside Networks | ❌ Not set | ❌ Prod webhook not registered | 🟡 |
| **Google OAuth** | ✅ | ❌ No credentials | ❌ Not set | ❌ Not registered in Google Console | 🔴 |
| **GitHub OAuth** | ✅ | ❌ No credentials | ❌ Not set | ❌ Not registered in GitHub | 🔴 |
| **Cloudflare** | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ Not set | ✅ Bindings configured | 🟡 |

### MVP-GOLIVE.AUTH
*Re-evaluate auth approach before launch*

- [ ] Re-evaluate JWT auth vs Astro Sessions — assess whether any workarounds during development would be better served by session-based auth (see `docs/as-designed/auth-sessions.md`)

### MVP-GOLIVE.STRIPE
*Payment processing and marketplace payouts*
**Tech Doc:** `docs/reference/stripe.md` (comprehensive webhook docs added Session 223)

**What's done:** Complete Stripe Connect integration — checkout, transfers (with idempotency keys), refunds, 7 webhook handlers (including dispute handling with transfer reversal), self-healing status sync, Express onboarding flow tested end-to-end. Staging webhook active at `staging.peerloop.pages.dev` (Session 224). Enrollment self-healing fallback for missed webhooks — success page SSR + /courses localStorage bridge (Session 324). Fixed `enrollments.student_teacher_id` FK mismatch (was inserting st-xxx instead of usr-xxx, Session 324). Fixed teacher profile session count JOINs and ST booking URL pre-selection (Session 324).

**Go-live steps:**
- [ ] Add `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` (`sk_live_...`) to CF Dashboard Production secrets
- [ ] Register webhook endpoint in Stripe Dashboard (live mode):
  - URL: `https://<production-domain>/api/webhooks/stripe`
  - Events: `checkout.session.completed`, `charge.refunded`, `account.updated`, `transfer.created`, `charge.dispute.created`, `charge.dispute.closed`
- [ ] Copy generated `whsec_...` to CF Dashboard as `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- [ ] Update `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` in `wrangler.toml` top-level `[vars]` to `pk_live_...`
- [ ] Test with real $1 charge → verify webhook arrives → refund immediately
- [ ] Configure Stripe branding (Dashboard → Settings → Branding):
  - [ ] Update account display name from "Alpha Peer LLC" to "Peerloop"
  - [ ] Upload Peerloop logo/icon (appears on Connect onboarding left panel)
  - [ ] Set brand color and accent color to match Peerloop palette

**Caveat:** Live-mode keys were intentionally deferred (Session 207, tech-026) to prevent accidental real charges during development.

**Pre-launch hardening:**
- [ ] Stripe Event Polling via Cron Trigger — catch-up for missed webhooks (enrollment self-healing done in Session 324; still needed for transfers, disputes, payout failures)
- [ ] Extended self-healing — reconcile transfer/dispute status on relevant page loads (enrollment self-healing done in Session 324; extend pattern to other entities)
- [ ] Dynamic admin lookup for dispute notifications (currently hardcoded to `'usr-admin'`; should query for admin role)
- [ ] Dispute evidence submission tooling (currently admin responds via Stripe Dashboard directly)
- [ ] `payout.failed` webhook endpoint (requires separate Connected accounts webhook in Stripe Dashboard)
- [ ] `checkout.session.expired` handler (clean up pending enrollments from abandoned checkouts)
- [ ] `transfer.reversed` handler (safety net for confirming transfer reversals)
- [ ] `/api/dev/simulate-checkout` endpoint (dev-only, skips Stripe Checkout redirect for faster manual testing)

### MVP-GOLIVE.STREAM
*Activity feeds (GetStream.io)*
**Tech Doc:** `docs/reference/stream.md`

**What's done:** REST API client (edge-compatible, no Node SDK), feed groups configured in dev app, enrollment-triggered follow relationships, course discussion feeds.

**Current config:**
- Dev/Preview app: `1457190` (configured in `wrangler.toml [env.preview.vars]`)
- Production app: `1456912` (configured in `wrangler.toml` top-level `[vars]`)

**Go-live steps:**
- [ ] Add `STREAM_API_SECRET` (prod app secret) to CF Dashboard Production secrets
- [ ] Verify Stream Dashboard (prod app `1456912`) has all feed groups:
  - `townhall` (flat), `course` (flat), `community` (flat)
  - `notification` (notification), `timeline` / `timeline_aggregated` (aggregated)
- [ ] Test feed creation and activity posting against prod app
- [ ] Verify token generation works with prod app credentials

**Note:** `STREAM_API_KEY` and `STREAM_APP_ID` are non-secrets already in `wrangler.toml`.

### MVP-GOLIVE.RESEND
*Transactional email*
**Tech Doc:** `docs/reference/resend.md`

**What's done:** SDK integrated, React Email templates framework, Cloudflare Workers compatible.

**API key status:** Verified working (Session 252, 2026-02-22). Dev key can send emails successfully. Without a verified domain, Resend restricts recipients to the account owner's email only.

**Go-live steps (CRITICAL — has lead time):**
- [ ] **Domain verification** — see **RESEND-DOMAIN** section above (moved out of go-live; do ASAP to unblock testing)
- [ ] Add `RESEND_API_KEY` (prod key `re_ZpBp...`) to CF Dashboard Production secrets
- [ ] Complete email templates: welcome, verification, password reset, session booking, payment receipt
- [ ] Test email delivery to real inboxes (check spam scoring)
- [ ] Implement email verification flow (depends on domain verification)
- [ ] Test moderator invite flow end-to-end (email delivery requires domain verification)
- [ ] (Optional) Configure Resend webhooks for bounce/complaint handling

**Caveat:** Without domain verification, emails send from `onboarding@resend.dev` which looks unprofessional and may be spam-filtered. Start DNS setup early.

### MVP-GOLIVE.BBB
*Video sessions (BigBlueButton via Blindside Networks)*
**Tech Doc:** `docs/reference/bigbluebutton.md`

**What's done:** VideoProvider interface, BBB adapter (with `!` encoding and URL normalization fixes), session CRUD + join + reschedule APIs, webhook handler, `/session/[id]` page, SessionRoom with `window.open()` + polling, recording endpoint, StudentDashboard upcoming sessions. Blindside Networks selected as managed BBB provider (no self-hosting needed).

**Go-live steps:**
- [ ] Get production BBB_SECRET from Blindside Networks (Binoy Wilson, `binoy.wilson@blindsidenetworks.com`)
- [ ] Add `BBB_SECRET` to CF Dashboard Production secrets
- [ ] `BBB_URL` already in `wrangler.toml` for all environments
- [ ] Configure BBB webhooks to call `https://<production-domain>/api/webhooks/bbb`
- [ ] Test meeting creation, join URLs, and recording with Blindside server

**Note:** No server provisioning needed — Blindside Networks provides managed BBB SaaS.

### MVP-GOLIVE.OAUTH
*Social login (Google + GitHub)*
**Tech Doc:** `docs/reference/google-oauth.md`

See OAUTH block for full checklist.

**Key lead-time item:** Google OAuth consent screen verification takes **1-2 weeks** for apps with >100 users. Start early.

### MVP-GOLIVE.CLOUDFLARE
*Infrastructure: D1, R2, KV, Pages*

**What's done:** All bindings configured in `wrangler.toml`. D1 databases exist (`peerloop-db` for prod, `peerloop-db-staging` for preview). R2 bucket `peerloop-storage` configured for both environments. KV namespace `SESSION` removed Conv 095 (unused — re-add for feature flags post-MVP).

**Go-live steps:**
- [ ] Add all secrets to CF Dashboard Production tab:
  - `JWT_SECRET` (generate fresh with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
  - All provider secrets listed above (Stripe, Stream, Resend, BBB, OAuth)
- [ ] Run `npm run db:migrate:prod` to apply schema to production D1
- [ ] Run `npm run db:setup:local:clean` to test fresh-install flow (no dev seed data)
- [ ] Verify R2 bucket permissions for production reads/writes
- [ ] Re-add KV `SESSION` namespace if feature flags needed (removed Conv 095)
- [ ] Configure custom domain in CF Pages (e.g., `peerloop.com`)
- [ ] Set up DNS records pointing domain to CF Pages

### MVP-GOLIVE.DOMAIN
*Production domain setup (prerequisite for most providers)*

**Why this matters:** Most provider registrations (Stripe webhook URL, OAuth callback URLs, Resend domain verification) require knowing the **exact production domain**. This should be decided first.

- [ ] Decide production domain (e.g., `peerloop.com`, `app.peerloop.com`)
- [ ] Configure domain in Cloudflare DNS
- [ ] Point domain to CF Pages deployment
- [ ] Verify HTTPS is working
- [ ] Update all provider configurations with final domain

### MVP-GOLIVE.EXECUTION_ORDER

Recommended order based on dependencies and lead times:

| Step | Provider | Why This Order | Lead Time |
|------|----------|---------------|-----------|
| 1 | **Domain** | All other providers need the production URL | Hours |
| 2 | **Cloudflare** | Secrets + DB migration; foundation for everything | Hours |
| 3 | **Resend** | DNS verification has variable wait time | Hours-24h |
| 4 | **Google OAuth** | Consent screen verification takes 1-2 weeks | **1-2 weeks** |
| 5 | **GitHub OAuth** | Quick registration, no verification needed | Minutes |
| 6 | **Stream.io** | Just add secret + verify feed groups | Minutes |
| 7 | **Stripe** | Register webhook + add secrets; test last | Hours |
| 8 | **BBB** | Heaviest infra; can defer if needed | Days-weeks |

### MVP-GOLIVE.OAUTH (absorbed Conv 095)

Code implemented and tested for both Google and GitHub OAuth. Missing: app registrations in provider consoles.

- [ ] Google: Create project, consent screen, OAuth Client ID, redirect URIs, add secrets to CF
- [ ] GitHub: Create OAuth App, callback URL, add secrets to CF
- [ ] Google consent screen verification: **1-2 weeks** for >100 users — start early
- [ ] See `docs/reference/google-oauth.md` for full walkthrough

### MVP-GOLIVE.CRON-CLEANUP (absorbed Conv 095)

Currently `detectNoShows()` + `detectStaleInProgress()` + `reconcileBBBSessions()` run manually via admin. For production, add `scheduled()` handler.

- [ ] Investigate Astro + CF adapter dual exports (`fetch` + `scheduled`)
- [ ] Add `[triggers]` cron config to `wrangler.toml`
- [ ] Implement `scheduled()` handler (cleanup + BBB reconciliation)
- [ ] Notification batching (daily digest vs individual alerts)

### MVP-GOLIVE.STAGING-VERIFY (absorbed Conv 095)

Unified staging integration tests for all external services. Replaces BBB-VERIFY remaining items.

- [ ] Stream: verify feed creation + activity posting against staging app
- [ ] Resend: plus-addressed email capture (`fgorrie+{handle}@bio-software.com`), verify delivery
- [ ] Stripe: staging webhook end-to-end verification
- [ ] BBB: verify analytics callback, `getRecordings` format, full recording flow (webhook → cookie download → R2)

### MVP-GOLIVE.RECORDING-PERSIST (absorbed Conv 095)

Cookie-based `.m4v` download implemented (Conv 037). Remaining:

- [ ] Verify `recording_url` populated by webhook on live BBB session
- [ ] Verify cookie-based download produces valid `.m4v`
- [ ] Confirm BBB shared secret matches `BBB_SECRET`
- [ ] Recording playback/download UI on session detail page
- [ ] Admin: expose `recording_size_bytes`, query recording status across sessions

## Deferred: PAGES-DEFERRED

**Focus:** 7 pages deferred per client directive — not yet designed for the Twitter-style left-side menu layout
**Status:** ⏸️ DEFERRED (post-MVP, pending client direction)
**Unimplemented stories:** 6 (US-S065, US-M004, US-C026, US-S081, US-P097, US-P099)

**Open question:** Current app pages use a Twitter-like left-side menu navigation. These more traditional/standard pages need layout decisions — do they use the same left-side menu pattern, or a different layout?

| Code | Page | Route | Stories | Notes |
|------|------|-------|---------|-------|
| HELP | Summon Help | `/help` | *(see GOODWILL block)* | Blocked on goodwill system |
| BLOG | Blog | `/blog` | — | Content not ready |
| CARE | Careers | `/careers` | — | Content not ready |
| CHAT | Course Chat | `/courses/:slug/chat` | US-S065, US-M004 | Superseded by community feeds |
| CNEW | Creator Newsletters | `/creating/newsletters` | US-C026 | Post-MVP |
| SUBCOM | Sub-Community | `/groups/:id` | US-S081, US-P097 | Post-MVP |
| CLOG | Changelog | `/changelog` | US-P099 | Gap story — no route exists yet |

## Deferred: RATINGS-EXT

**Focus:** Extended ratings features beyond core session/completion reviews
**Status:** 📋 PLANNING
**Tech Doc:** `docs/as-designed/ratings-feedback.md`

**Context:** Core rating system is complete (session assessments + completion reviews). These extensions add richer feedback dimensions and display.

### RATINGS-EXT.EXPECTATIONS

*Capture student goals/expectations at enrollment time*

- [ ] `enrollment_expectations` table (schema in tech-022)
- [ ] POST endpoint to capture expectations post-purchase
- [ ] Optional update after each session
- [ ] Display in completion review context ("did course meet expectations?")

### RATINGS-EXT.MATERIALS

*Separate course content quality rating from teaching quality*

- [ ] `course_reviews` table with optional sub-ratings (clarity, relevance, depth)
- [ ] Add `rating` and `rating_count` columns to `courses` table
- [ ] Two-part completion review modal (teaching + materials)
- [ ] Course page displays materials rating separately from Teacher rating
- [ ] Creator analytics: materials feedback breakdown

### RATINGS-EXT.DISPLAY

*Surface ratings in more places*

- [ ] Show completion reviews on Teacher public profile page
- [ ] Rating trend charts in Teacher/Creator analytics dashboards

---

## Deferred: EMAIL-TZ

**Focus:** Format notification/email times in recipient's local timezone
**Status:** 📋 PENDING
**Conv:** 002

**Context:** Conv 002 completed UTC-TIMES (session timezone normalization). Emails currently show times in UTC with "UTC" label. For polish, format in recipient's timezone — requires adding `timezone` column to users table and querying it during notification formatting.

- [ ] Add `timezone TEXT` column to users table (IANA timezone string, e.g., `America/New_York`)
- [ ] Populate during onboarding or profile settings (detect from browser `Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone`)
- [ ] Use `formatLocalTime(utcIso, userTimezone)` in session creation, reschedule, and cancellation email formatting
- [ ] Use `formatLocalTime()` in in-app notification text

---

## Deferred: PUBLIC-PAGES

**Focus:** Unified header/footer/nav/currentUser strategy for public-facing pages
**Status:** 📋 PENDING
**Session:** 385

**Context:** Session 385 audit found three layout/header components serving different page types, each with independent auth patterns:

| Layout | Header Component | Auth Pattern | Pages |
|--------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| `AppLayout` | `AppNavbar.tsx` | `initializeCurrentUser()` (full `/api/me/full`) | ~54 authenticated pages |
| `AdminLayout` | `AdminNavbar.tsx` | `initializeCurrentUser()` (full `/api/me/full`) | 14 admin pages |
| `LandingLayout` | `Header.tsx` | `fetch('/api/auth/session')` (lightweight) | ~26 public pages |
| `LegacyAppLayout` | `AppHeader.tsx` | `fetch('/api/auth/session')` + notification count | Deprecated, still mounted |

**Problems to solve:**

1. **Header.tsx uses stale role booleans** — `/api/auth/session` returns `is_student`, `is_teacher`, `is_creator` as flat DB flags, not derived from actual course relationships. A user with `can_create_courses=true` but zero created courses shows "Creator Dashboard" link incorrectly.

2. **Header.tsx `getDashboardLink()` duplicates AppNavbar logic** — role-priority routing (admin → creator → teacher → student) is implemented independently in both components with different field names (`is_admin` vs `isAdmin`).

3. **No shared footer** — public and app pages have no consistent footer component. Marketing pages need footer nav (About, Privacy, Terms, etc.), app pages may need a slimmer version.

4. **AppHeader.tsx (legacy) is a dead-end** — has its own mobile sidebar with hardcoded routes that don't match AppNavbar. Should be removed once all pages use AppLayout.

5. **Public pages can't personalize for returning users** — e.g., `/courses` could show "Continue Learning" for enrolled courses, but Header.tsx doesn't initialize currentUser and there's no `getCurrentUserIfCached()` helper.

### PUBLIC-PAGES.HEADER-UNIFY

*Unify Header.tsx auth with currentUser cache*

- [ ] Add `getCurrentUserIfCached()` to `current-user.ts` — reads localStorage only, no fetch, returns `CurrentUser | null`
- [ ] Refactor `Header.tsx` to use `getCurrentUserIfCached()` instead of `/api/auth/session`
- [ ] Fall back to lightweight session fetch only if no cache exists (first-time visitor who never visited an AppLayout page)
- [ ] Replace stale `is_teacher`/`is_creator` booleans with currentUser's `isActiveTeacher()`/`hasCreatedCourses()` for accurate dashboard routing
- [ ] Extract shared `getDashboardLink(user)` utility used by both Header and AppNavbar

### PUBLIC-PAGES.LEGACY-CLEANUP

*Remove AppHeader.tsx and LegacyAppLayout*

- [ ] Audit which pages (if any) still use `LegacyAppLayout.astro`
- [ ] Migrate remaining pages to `AppLayout.astro`
- [ ] Delete `AppHeader.tsx` and `LegacyAppLayout.astro`
- [ ] Remove `AppHeader` from any component exports/barrels

### PUBLIC-PAGES.FOOTER

*Shared footer component for public and app pages*

- [ ] Design footer structure (links, social, copyright)
- [ ] Create `Footer.astro` component (zero JS, build-time)
- [ ] Add to `LandingLayout.astro`
- [ ] Decide whether app pages need a footer variant (likely no — sidebar layout doesn't need one)

### PUBLIC-PAGES.PERSONALIZATION

*Returning-user awareness on public pages (stretch)*

- [ ] `/courses` — show "Continue Learning" badge on enrolled courses via `getCurrentUserIfCached()`
- [ ] `/` (landing) — show "Go to Dashboard" instead of "Get Started" for cached users
- [ ] `EnrollButton` on public course pages — instant "Go to Course" for enrolled users (no fetch needed)

## Deferred: CERT-APPROVAL

**Focus:** Full certificate lifecycle — creator approval UI, student certificate page, PDF generation & R2 storage, dead link fixes
**Status:** 📋 PENDING
**Origin:** Session 359 (capabilities review), Conv 007 (seed data review), Session 390 (LearnTab blocker), Conv 042 (CompletedTabContent dead link)

### What Exists

| Piece | Status | Location |
|-------|--------|----------|
| `certificates` table | ✅ Full schema | `migrations/0001_schema.sql:650` — id, user_id, course_id, type (completion/mastery/teaching), status (pending/issued/revoked), certificate_url (always NULL), recommended_by, issued_by |
| Admin list/create | ✅ Built | `GET/POST /api/admin/certificates` — paginated listing with status/type filters + stats |
| Admin approve | ✅ Built | `POST /api/admin/certificates/[id]/approve` — pending→issued, syncs `teacher_certifications` for teaching certs, sends email via Resend (`CertificateIssuedEmail`) + notification |
| Admin reject | ✅ Built | `POST /api/admin/certificates/[id]/reject` — hard-deletes pending cert |
| Admin revoke | ✅ Built | `POST /api/admin/certificates/[id]/revoke` — issued→revoked, deactivates teaching cert if applicable |
| Teacher recommend | ✅ Built | `POST /api/me/certificates/recommend` — teacher recommends enrolled student, creates `pending` cert (validates: active teacher, certified for course, student enrolled, student completed for teaching certs) |
| My certificates | ✅ Built | `GET /api/me/certificates` — user's own certs with course/issuer joins |
| Public verify | ✅ Built | `GET /api/certificates/[id]/verify` — no-auth verification endpoint |
| CompletedTabContent | ⚠️ Dead link | `src/components/discover/detail-tabs/CompletedTabContent.tsx:40` — links to `/course/[slug]/certificate` (doesn't exist), has "coming soon" disclaimer |
| LearnTab | ⚠️ TODO | `src/components/courses/LearnTab.tsx:382` — commented TODO for certificate link |

### What's Missing

**The certificate lifecycle has 5 gaps:**

1. **Creator has no approval UI** — Only admin can approve/reject. The flywheel requires creators to certify their own students. Creator dashboard has no pending-certificates view.
2. **Creator not notified** — When a teacher recommends a student, no notification goes to the course creator. Only admin would see it.
3. **No student certificate page** — `/course/[slug]/certificate` doesn't exist. Two UI elements link to it (CompletedTabContent, LearnTab TODO).
4. **No PDF generation** — No library installed, no template designed, `certificate_url` is always NULL. R2 helpers exist (`src/lib/r2.ts`) but no cert-specific upload code.
5. **No public certificate view** — The verify endpoint returns JSON; there's no shareable HTML page for a certificate.

### CERT-APPROVAL.PHASE-1 — Dead Link Fix + Student Certificate Page

*Minimum viable: show certificate status to students who earned one, fix dead links*

- [ ] Create `/course/[slug]/certificate` page (Astro SSR)
  - Fetch user's certificate for this course via `GET /api/me/certificates` (filter by course)
  - States: not-authenticated → login redirect, no-certificate → "not earned", pending → "awaiting approval", issued → certificate display, revoked → revoked message
  - Issued state: show course name, student name, issue date, certificate ID, issuer name, type badge
  - If `certificate_url` exists: "Download PDF" button (for Phase 3)
  - If `certificate_url` is NULL: "PDF coming soon" note (graceful degradation)
  - Public share link: `/certificates/[id]/verify` (already exists as API, needs HTML page — see Phase 4)
- [ ] Fix CompletedTabContent dead link (`src/components/discover/detail-tabs/CompletedTabContent.tsx:40`)
  - Link should go to `/course/${courseSlug}/certificate` — URL is correct, just needs the page to exist
  - Remove "coming soon" disclaimer once page is live
- [ ] Fix LearnTab TODO (`src/components/courses/LearnTab.tsx:382`)
  - Add "View Certificate" link in completion celebration card
- [ ] Tests: certificate page rendering (all 5 states), auth redirect, data display

### CERT-APPROVAL.PHASE-2 — Creator Approval Flow

*Creator-facing certification management — the flywheel step where creators certify graduates*

- [ ] `GET /api/me/courses/[id]/pending-certificates` — list pending certs for a creator's course
- [ ] `POST /api/me/courses/[id]/certificates/[certId]/approve` — creator approves (reuse approve logic from admin endpoint, verify creator owns course)
- [ ] `POST /api/me/courses/[id]/certificates/[certId]/reject` — creator rejects with reason
- [ ] Creator notification: when teacher recommends a student, notify the course creator (new notification type: `cert.recommendation_received`)
- [ ] Creator dashboard UI: "Pending Certifications" section or tab showing students awaiting approval
  - Student name, course, recommending teacher, recommendation date
  - Approve / Reject buttons with confirmation
- [ ] Student notification on approval/rejection (approval notification already exists via admin flow — verify it fires for creator approval too)
- [ ] Tests: creator approval/rejection, authorization (only course creator can approve), notification delivery
- [ ] Build "Recommend for Certification" UI button on teacher-facing student views (Conv 082: `POST /api/me/certificates/recommend` has zero UI consumers)
- [ ] Fix dashboard attention item "Certification recommendation" → link to actionable destination (currently `/teaching/students` has no recommend action)
- [ ] Unified admin visibility for both certification paths (creator direct writes to `teacher_certifications` only; recommend/approve writes to `certificates` then syncs — admin Certificate Management page only shows `certificates` table)

### CERT-APPROVAL.PHASE-3 — PDF Generation & R2 Storage

*Generate certificate PDFs on approval and store to R2*

- [ ] Choose PDF library — candidates: `pdf-lib` (lightweight, no native deps, CF Workers compatible), `@react-pdf/renderer` (React-based templates), or server-side HTML→PDF
  - **Constraint:** Must work in Cloudflare Workers environment (no Puppeteer/Chrome)
- [ ] Design certificate template: course name, student name, date, certificate ID, type badge, creator signature area, verification QR code
- [ ] `generateCertificatePDF(cert)` function in `src/lib/certificates.ts`
- [ ] Hook into approve endpoint: generate PDF → upload to R2 at `certificates/{cert_id}/certificate.pdf` → store URL in `certificates.certificate_url`
- [ ] Update student certificate page: when `certificate_url` exists, show "Download PDF" button
- [ ] Seed data: add sample certificate URLs once generation works
- [ ] Tests: PDF generation, R2 upload, URL storage

### CERT-APPROVAL.PHASE-4 — Public Certificate Page (Optional)

*Shareable HTML certificate view — currently verify endpoint is JSON-only*

- [ ] Create `/certificates/[id]` public page (no auth required)
  - Shows: recipient, course, issuer, date, type, validity status
  - Revoked certs: show revoked status with date
  - QR code linking back to this page for physical certificate verification
- [ ] Update student certificate page: "Share" button with copyable public URL
- [ ] Consider: Open Graph meta tags for social sharing preview

## Active: ADMIN-REVIEW

**Focus:** Admin system review — testing gaps, UI consistency, cross-links, menu restructure, settings UI
**Status:** 📋 PENDING (promoted to active Conv 095)
**Absorbs:** ROLES (create UI, audit), ADMIN-SETTINGS-UI
**Conv:** 080 (audit only)

**Risk model:** 2 max users, high trust. Admins develop usage patterns and don't exercise breadth/edge cases. Regressions in decision-data (what the admin sees) or action-execution (what the admin does) are silently catastrophic — wrong data leads to wrong decisions, broken actions fail without the admin realizing.

**Audit baseline (Conv 080):**

| Layer | Source | Tested | Tests | File Coverage |
|-------|--------|--------|-------|---------------|
| Admin components | 28 | 19 | ~876 | 68% |
| Admin APIs | 67 | 55 | ~916 | 82% |
| Admin intel | — | 6 | ~50 | separate |
| Moderator component | 1 | 1 | 59 | 100% |
| **Total** | **96** | **81** | **~1900** | |

**Also completed Conv 080:** Replaced all 23 `prompt()` calls with `FormModal` across 6 admin/moderation files. Created `src/components/ui/FormModal.tsx`. Updated 2 test files.

### ADMIN-REVIEW.TESTING

**Gate question (ask at block start):** Full test implementation for all gaps, or risk-profile-prioritized subset?

#### Category 1: Decision Data — must be correct

These show admins the data they use to make decisions. Wrong/missing fields → wrong decisions.

| Gap | What It Shows | Decision It Feeds |
|-----|--------------|-------------------|
| `CreatorApplicationDetailContent` | Application for creator role | Approve/deny creator |
| `ModeratorDetailContent` | Moderator info + activity | Remove moderator |
| `UserEditModal` | Role editing form | Role assignment (escalation risk) |
| 12 × `[id].ts` API endpoints | Single-record fetch for detail panels | All detail views — a regressed field is invisible to the admin |

The 12 missing API endpoints (all GET single-record):
- `admin/enrollments/[id].ts`
- `admin/teachers/[id].ts`
- `admin/certificates/[id].ts`
- `admin/courses/[id].ts`
- `admin/sessions/[id].ts`
- `admin/users/[id].ts`
- `admin/payouts/[id].ts`
- `admin/topics/[id].ts`
- `admin/moderation/[id].ts`
- `admin/intel/courses.ts`
- `admin/intel/dashboard.ts`
- `admin/intel/communities.ts`

These are highly templatable — same pattern (auth, 404, 200 + shape validation) repeated 12 times.

#### Category 2: Action Execution — must be bulletproof

Components that trigger irreversible or hard-to-reverse operations. API tests exist but component→API wiring is untested.

| Gap | Actions | Risk |
|-----|---------|------|
| `ModeratorsAdmin` | Invite (FormModal), revoke, remove | Permission escalation/revocation |
| `TopicsAdmin` | Reorder, CRUD topics/tags | Affects course categorization site-wide |

#### Category 3: Shared Infrastructure — cascade risk

Building blocks used by every admin view. Currently tested only indirectly through parent components. A regression breaks N tests simultaneously, making root-cause diagnosis harder.

| Gap | Used By | Role |
|-----|---------|------|
| `AdminDataTable` | Every admin list view | Sorting, row selection, rendering |
| `AdminDetailPanel` | Every admin detail view | Panel open/close, sections, fields |
| `AdminFilterBar` | Every admin list view | Search, filter dropdowns |
| `AdminPagination` | Every admin list view | Page navigation, items-per-page |
| `AdminActionMenu` | Every row action | Action buttons, variants, disabled |

#### Approach options

| Option | Strategy | Sequence | Trade-off |
|--------|----------|----------|-----------|
| A | Bottom-up | Primitives → Actions → Data → APIs | Clean isolation, more upfront work |
| B | Risk-first | Actions → Data → Primitives → APIs | Highest-risk first, harder diagnosis |
| C | Hybrid | `AdminDataTable` + `AdminDetailPanel` → `ModeratorsAdmin` + `TopicsAdmin` → Detail contents → APIs. Skip `AdminFilterBar`/`Pagination`/`ActionMenu` (well-exercised indirectly). | Best risk/effort ratio |

**Recommendation:** Option C (hybrid) — gets infrastructure diagnostic value for the two highest-cascade primitives, then closes the action-execution and decision-data gaps. The 12 API endpoints batch separately regardless of option.

#### Quality notes from Conv 080 audit

- API tests use real `better-sqlite3` via `describeWithTestDB` — not mocks. Strong pattern.
- Component tests use `@testing-library/react` + `userEvent` — real interaction, not implementation-detail testing.
- `beforeEach` resets DB state — no cross-test contamination.
- No admin E2E tests — component fetch URLs aren't verified against actual API routes. A URL typo passes both layers independently.
- Test counts per file range from 15 (CreatorApplicationsAdmin) to 70 (ModerationDetailContent) — indicating depth varies.

### ADMIN-REVIEW.MENU

**Gate question (ask at block start):** Confirm current menu structure is still accurate before making changes.

#### Current Menu Structure (12 items in 3 groups)

```
OVERVIEW
└─ Dashboard (/admin)

MANAGEMENT (9 items)
├─ Users          ├─ Courses        ├─ Topics
├─ Enrollments    ├─ Teachers       ├─ Sessions
├─ Payouts        ├─ Certificates   └─ Creator Apps

MODERATION (2 items)
├─ Moderation Queue
└─ Moderators

HIDDEN (no menu entry)
└─ Analytics (/admin/analytics) — accessible by URL only
```

#### Assessment

**A. Missing from menu:**
- `/admin/analytics` exists as a full page but has no sidebar entry. Admin must know the URL.

**B. Grouping doesn't match workflow:**

The flat MANAGEMENT list has 9 items in alphabetical-ish order. But admins think in workflows, not entity types. Related items aren't adjacent:

| Workflow | Current Items (scattered) |
|----------|--------------------------|
| User lifecycle | Users → Creator Apps → Teachers → Certificates |
| Course lifecycle | Courses → Topics → Enrollments → Sessions |
| Money | Payouts (alone) |

**Recommendation:** Regroup by workflow proximity:

```
OVERVIEW
└─ Dashboard
└─ Analytics                          ← promote from hidden

PEOPLE
├─ Users
├─ Creator Apps                       ← adjacent to Users (user applies → admin reviews)
├─ Teachers                           ← certified users
└─ Moderators                         ← moved from MODERATION group

COURSES & LEARNING
├─ Courses
├─ Topics                             ← course metadata
├─ Enrollments                        ← students in courses
├─ Sessions                           ← scheduled learning
└─ Certificates                       ← completion artifacts

OPERATIONS
├─ Payouts                            ← money
└─ Moderation Queue                   ← content review
```

This groups 12+1 items into 4 semantic clusters. The admin's eye can scan to the right section by intent ("I need to deal with a person" vs "I need to check a course-related thing").

**C. Cross-linking between admin views:**

The `admin-links.ts` module provides `?highlight=` navigation between admin list views. Currently supported:

| From Detail Panel | Can Navigate To |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| User → | Profile page (member-facing) |
| Course → | Course page, Creator profile |
| Enrollment → | Course page (but NOT student profile) |
| Session → | Course page (but NOT student/teacher profiles, NOT enrollment) |
| Certificate → | Profile page, Course page |
| Payout → | Recipient profile (but NOT individual splits/transactions) |
| Moderation → | Target user profile (but NOT flagger profile) |

**Missing cross-links (high value for admin workflow):**

| Gap | Why It Matters |
|-----|---------------|
| Session → Student/Teacher profiles | Admin resolving session dispute needs to see participant history |
| Session → Enrollment | Admin needs enrollment context (payment, progress) for session issues |
| Enrollment → Student profile | Admin reviewing enrollment can't quickly check student status |
| Payout → Source enrollments/courses | Admin verifying payout can't trace to originating transactions |
| Moderation → Flagger profile | Admin assessing credibility of flag can't see who flagged it |

**D. Dual-link pattern: admin-to-admin + admin-to-member (both required):**

**Design principle:** The admin↔member boundary is intentionally bidirectional. Existing `memberUrlFor` links (`/@handle`, `/discover/course/slug`) let admins cross into the member side to see what members experience and use the ADMIN-INTEL overlays available there. This is by design — it keeps admins "in touch" with the member experience and puts decision-making apparatus on the member side.

**What's missing** is the other direction: admin-to-admin links that stay within the admin system. From SessionDetail, clicking a student name should offer BOTH `/@handle` (see them as a member) AND `/admin/users?highlight={userId}` (see them in admin context among like users). The `admin-links.ts` infrastructure already supports this via `adminUrlFor`.

**Implementation pattern:** For each entity reference in a detail panel, show two links:
- 🔗 `adminUrlFor(type, id)` — opens in admin context (primary, labeled e.g. "Admin →")
- 👤 `memberUrlFor(type, slug)` — opens in member context (secondary, labeled e.g. "Member →")

**CRITICAL: Never remove existing `memberUrlFor` links.** They are the admin's window into the member experience. Admin-to-admin links are additive.

### ADMIN-REVIEW.UI

**Gate question (ask at block start):** Confirm the functional/convenient priority still holds — not a visual polish pass.

**Design principles for this subblock:**
- Not pretty, but functional and convenient. Related items easily reachable from inside pages. Sidebar as secondary navigation.
- **Bidirectional boundary crossing:** Admin↔Member boundary is intentionally porous. Admin-to-member links (`memberUrlFor`) let admins experience the app as members see it + use ADMIN-INTEL overlays. Admin-to-admin links (`adminUrlFor`) let admins see entities in admin context among like entities. Both directions must coexist — never remove one to add the other.

#### Assessment: What works well

1. **Shared component architecture is strong.** All list views use `AdminFilterBar → AdminDataTable → AdminPagination → AdminDetailPanel` consistently. Pattern is learned once, works everywhere.
2. **Detail panels are rich.** `PanelSection` / `PanelField` / `StatusBadge` / `RoleBadge` give uniform information density.
3. **Action patterns are consistent.** ConfirmModal (now + FormModal) → toast → list refresh. Predictable feedback loop.
4. **Dashboard provides genuine operational value.** Alerts, quick actions, session cleanup, recent activity — not just vanity metrics.

#### Assessment: Friction points

**F1. Inconsistent status filtering patterns**

| View | Status Selection | Pattern |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| Users, Courses, Enrollments, Teachers, Sessions | Dropdown filter | Standard |
| Certificates | Tab bar (`all \| pending \| issued \| revoked`) | Outlier |
| Payouts | Hybrid: pending tab + dropdown for others | Outlier |

Admin learns dropdown pattern, hits tabs in Certificates, hits hybrid in Payouts. Recommendation: standardize on dropdowns for all, OR standardize on tabs for views where status is the primary workflow axis (Certificates, Payouts, Moderation). Pick one and apply consistently.

**F2. Dead feature: EnrollmentsAdmin stats**

API returns `stats: {total, active, completed, cancelled}` — component fetches but never renders them. Either display as summary cards above the table (like Dashboard metrics) or stop fetching.

**F3. PayoutsAdmin pending mode is a different UI entirely**

Pending tab shows grouped-by-recipient expandable view. All other tabs show standard table. This is the only view with two fundamentally different layouts. Recommendation: either make the grouped view the standard (with status column to distinguish), or split into two pages (`/admin/payouts` for history, `/admin/payouts/pending` for processing).

**F4. Missing admin-to-admin cross-links in detail panels (additive — keep member links)**

Detail panels link to member-facing pages (`/@handle`, `/discover/course/slug`) — this is intentional and must be preserved. These links let admins cross into the member experience to see what members see and use ADMIN-INTEL overlays for in-context decision-making.

What's missing is the **complementary** admin-to-admin direction. An admin investigating a session dispute who wants to see the student's admin record has to:
1. Open session detail
2. Note the student name
3. Close panel
4. Navigate to Users
5. Search for the student
6. Open their detail

Should be: click student name in session detail → `/admin/users?highlight={userId}` (admin view) alongside the existing `/@handle` (member view).

The `admin-links.ts` infrastructure exists for this (`adminUrlFor('user', id)` → `/admin/users?highlight={id}`). It's just not wired into most detail content components.

**Implementation:** Dual-link pattern per entity reference — admin link (primary) + member link (secondary, existing). See .MENU §D for pattern details.

**Priority detail panels for admin-to-admin wiring:**
- `SessionDetailContent` — student, teacher, enrollment links
- `EnrollmentDetailContent` — student link
- `PayoutDetailContent` — source course/enrollment links
- `ModerationDetailContent` — flagger link

**F5. No filter persistence across navigation**

Navigating away from a filtered list and returning clears all filters. Admin must re-enter search criteria. Low-cost fix: store filter state in URL query params (already partially supported via `?highlight=`).

**F6. TopicsAdmin has no detail panel**

Only admin view without a detail panel. Cannot view topic metadata, associated course count, or tag usage. Actions are limited to reorder and delete. Recommendation: add a lightweight detail panel showing course count, creation date, and usage stats.

**F7. Admin page-level auth guard gap (Conv 082)** ✅ Fixed Conv 083

~~Non-admin users can navigate to `/admin/*` pages and see the full admin sidebar layout before the API rejects the data request.~~ Auth guard added to `AdminLayout.astro` — checks JWT, verifies session, confirms admin role. Unauthenticated → `/login`, non-admin → `/`.

**F8. ModeratorsAdmin has no detail panel content**

`ModeratorDetailContent.tsx` exists as a file but its completeness should be verified at block start. If the panel shows basic info only, it should display moderation activity stats (flags reviewed, actions taken).

#### Recommended execution order

1. **Menu restructure** (ADMIN-REVIEW.MENU) — regroup sidebar, promote Analytics, add admin-to-admin links in detail panels
2. **Filter consistency** (F1) — pick tabs vs dropdowns and standardize
3. **Cross-link wiring** (F4) — wire `adminUrlFor` into detail content components (SessionDetail, EnrollmentDetail, PayoutDetail, ModerationDetail)
4. **Dead feature cleanup** (F2, F3) — render EnrollmentsAdmin stats or remove; decide on PayoutsAdmin pending layout
5. **Filter persistence** (F5) — URL query param state for filters
6. **TopicsAdmin detail panel** (F6) — lightweight panel with course count
7. **ModeratorsAdmin detail panel** (F8) — verify and enhance if needed

Items 1-4 are functional improvements (convenience, workflow). Items 5-7 are polish (nice-to-have for 2-user system).

## Deferred: IMAGES

**Focus:** Image pipeline — upload endpoints, management UI, delivery optimization
**Status:** 📋 PENDING
**Merged Conv 095:** FILE-UPLOADS + IMAGE-MGMT + IMAGE-OPTIMIZE

**Current state:** R2 helpers exist (`src/lib/r2.ts`). Image display complete (Conv 023: unified fallback, community covers, FeedsHub images). Schema columns exist. No POST upload endpoints. Dev seed uses static placeholder avatar.

## Deferred: STUMBLE-REMNANTS

**Focus:** Deferred findings from STUMBLE-AUDIT walkthroughs (Conv 067-088)
**Status:** 📋 PENDING

### Cross-referenced (tracked in other blocks)

These items are already detailed in their respective blocks — listed here for traceability back to the walkthrough that found them.

**→ CERT-APPROVAL:**
- Broken route: `/course/[slug]/certificate` — page doesn't exist, linked from discover pages (Conv 068)
- No "Recommend for Certification" UI button (teacher side) — `POST /api/me/certificates/recommend` has zero UI consumers (Conv 082)
- Dashboard "Certification recommendation" attention item links to `/teaching/students` which has no recommend action — dead-end (Conv 082)
- Two parallel certification paths (creator direct vs recommend/approve) with no unified admin visibility (Conv 082)

**→ PLATO (Post-MVP):**
- Create `post-enrollment` instance and `multi-student` scenario (design in `plato.md`)

### Standalone items

- [ ] The Commons `member_count` denormalized counter out of sync — seed/auto-join doesn't update counter (Conv 082). Fix: update counter in `autoJoinTheCommons()` or add a post-seed SQL fixup.
- [ ] Expired/invalid JWT session tokens — no test coverage (requires infra-level test changes to mock token expiry)

### Client decisions required

- [ ] Remove MyXXX pages (`/courses`, `/feeds`, `/communities`) — redundant with unified dashboard? Needs client confirmation.
- [ ] Home page differentiation for new members — currently shows same Twitter-like feed for everyone (Conv 067)
