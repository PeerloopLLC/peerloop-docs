## URL Routing Architecture

**Decision Date:** 2026-02-03 (Session 169)
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-01 (Session 317: BROKENLINKS — 20 new pages, 84 total)
**Status:** Adopted
**Affects:** All page routes, navigation, links

---

## Overview

PeerLoop uses a "bare = my" routing convention where authenticated users see their personal content at bare routes, and site-wide discovery uses the `/discover/` prefix.

---

## Core Principles

| Principle | Pattern | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| Bare route = My stuff | `/thing` | `/courses` = my enrolled courses |
| Discovery = Site-wide | `/discover/thing` | `/discover/courses` = course catalog |
| Singular for resources | `/thing/[id]` | `/course/python-101` (not `/courses/`) |
| Plural for collections | `/discover/things` | `/discover/courses` |
| Activity for dashboards | `/doing` | `/teaching`, `/creating`, `/learning` |
| Resource for profiles | `/thing/[id]` | `/creator/[handle]`, `/teacher/[handle]` |
| Universal profiles | `/@handle` | `/@jane` = Jane's unified profile |
| Settings are implicit | `/settings/*` | No `/my/` prefix needed |

---

## Singular vs Plural Convention

**Established:** Session 175 (2026-02-03)

| Type | Pattern | Examples |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Individual resource** | `/{singular}/[param]` | `/course/[slug]`, `/creator/[handle]` |
| **Resource sub-routes** | `/{singular}/[param]/{action}` | `/course/[slug]/learn`, `/course/[slug]/book` |
| **Discovery/collections** | `/discover/{plural}` | `/discover/courses`, `/discover/creators` |
| **Personal collections** | `/{plural}` (bare) | `/courses` (my enrolled) |
| **API endpoints** | `/api/{plural}/` | `/api/courses/`, `/api/creators/` |

**Rationale:** REST convention distinguishes collections from individual resources. Shorter URLs for profile pages are more shareable.

---

## Activity vs Resource Namespaces

**Established:** Session 177 (2026-02-04)

Dashboard and tool pages use **activity namespaces** (verb/gerund form), while public pages use **resource namespaces** (noun form):

| Namespace | Type | Purpose | Examples |
|-----------|------|---------|----------|
| `/creating/*` | Activity | Creator's dashboard & tools | `/creating`, `/creating/studio`, `/creating/communities`, `/creating/earnings` |
| `/teaching/*` | Activity | Teacher's dashboard & tools | `/teaching`, `/teaching/sessions`, `/teaching/earnings`, `/teaching/students` |
| `/learning/*` | Activity | Student's dashboard & tools | `/learning`, `/learning/sessions` |
| `/creator/*` | Resource | Creator profiles (public) | `/creator/[handle]` |
| `/teacher/*` | Resource | Teacher profiles (public) | `/teacher/[handle]` |
| `/course/*` | Resource | Course pages (public) | `/course/[slug]`, `/course/[slug]/book` |

**Rationale:** Clear separation between private dashboard tools ("what I'm doing") and public profile pages ("who this person is").

---

## Community & Feed Architecture

**Established:** Session 181 (2026-02-04)
**Updated:** Session 183 (2026-02-04) - Removed creator feeds

### Feed Hierarchy

```
Creator
└── Communities (many)
    ├── Community Feed (1) ← /community/[slug] (community IS the feed)
    └── Courses (many)
        └── Course Feed (1) ← /course/[slug]/feed
```

**Key Rules:**
- **1:1 Community:Feed** — Each community has exactly one feed; the community page IS the feed
- **Tags, not feeds** — Announcements, Help, etc. are post tags within a feed, not separate feeds
- **The Commons** — PeerLoop community's feed (auto-subscribed for all users)
- **No creator feeds** — Creators use communities for announcements (avoids user feed slippery slope)

### My Feeds Section (AppNavbar)

| Section | SlideOut Panel | Hub Page |
|---------|----------------|----------|
| My Communities | Communities I've joined | `/community` |
| Course Feeds | Courses I'm enrolled in | — (via `/course/[slug]/feed`) |

### Community Routes

| Route | Purpose | Auth |
|-------|---------|------|
| `/community` | My Communities hub (The Commons at top, then joined) | Optional |
| `/community/[slug]` | Community Feed tab (default) | Optional |
| `/community/[slug]/courses` | Community Courses tab | Optional |
| `/community/[slug]/resources` | Community Resources tab | Optional |
| `/community/[slug]/members` | Community Members tab | Optional |
| `/community/[slug]?tag=help` | Filtered feed view by tag | Optional |
| `/discover/communities` | Find communities to join | Public |

**Note:** The Commons (`isSystem: true`) redirects `/community/the-commons/courses` to `/community/the-commons` since system communities don't have courses.

**The Commons special case:**
- Slug: `the-commons` (or `peerloop`)
- Auto-subscribed for all users (including visitors)
- Tags for categorization: `general`, `announcements`, `help`

### Feed Routes

| Route | Purpose | Auth |
|-------|---------|------|
| `/course/[slug]/feed` | Course feed (tabbed UI) | Enrolled |
| `/feed` | Aggregated personalized feed | Required |

**Note:** Creator feeds (`/creator/[handle]/feed`) were removed in Session 183. Creators should create communities for announcements.

### Hub Page Pattern

The `/community` page mirrors the My Communities SlideOut Panel, just as `/discover` mirrors the Discovery SlideOut Panel:

```
/community                  /discover
├── The Commons             ├── Courses
├── ─────────────           ├── Teachers
└── [Joined communities]    ├── Creators
                            ├── Communities
                            └── Leaderboard
```

---

---

## Why This Design

### 1. Student-First Default

Most users are students. Their primary view is personal: "my courses, my learning." Bare routes serve this majority use case.

### 2. Discovery is Intentional

Users explicitly navigate to `/discover` to find new content. This matches the learning journey: you enroll first, then learn. Discovery is exploration, not the default.

### 3. Flywheel-Aligned Routes

As users progress through the PeerLoop flywheel (Student → Teacher → Creator), their routes evolve naturally:
- `/learning` → Student phase
- `/teaching` → Teacher phase
- `/creating` → Creator phase

### 4. Activity vs Resource Clarity

Dashboard routes use gerunds (`/teaching`, `/creating`) to communicate "what I'm doing." Public profile routes use nouns (`/teacher/`, `/creator/`) to communicate "who this is." This prevents confusion between viewing someone's profile and accessing your own tools.

### 5. Singular Resources, Plural Collections

Following REST conventions:
- `/course/python-101` - One specific course (singular)
- `/discover/courses` - Many courses to browse (plural)
- `/courses` - My collection of enrolled courses (plural, personal)

### 6. Universal Profile URLs

The `/@handle` pattern:
- Short, memorable, shareable
- Works for all user types (students, teachers, creators)
- Adapts display based on viewer's relationship
- Standard pattern (Twitter/X, Instagram, etc.)

Role-specific routes (`/creator/[handle]`, `/teacher/[handle]`) provide focused views when the context is known.

### 7. Detail Pages Are Canonical

Course detail pages (`/course/[slug]`) are the shareable URL regardless of enrollment status. The page adapts its CTAs based on context. This is the standard e-commerce pattern.

## Implementation Notes

### Astro File Structure

**Convention:** Use flat files (`route.astro`) not folders (`route/index.astro`) unless sub-routes are needed.

### Redirect Handling

#### Implemented Redirects

| Source | Destination | Type | Location |
|--------|-------------|------|----------|
| `/profile` | `/@me` | 301 (permanent) | `src/pages/profile.astro` |
| `/community/the-commons/courses` | `/community/the-commons` | Astro.redirect | System community special case |
| Protected routes (unauthenticated) | `/login?redirect={originalUrl}` | 302 (temporary) | Auth guards in page files + `src/lib/auth/session.ts` |
| `/api/auth/github` | GitHub OAuth URL | 302 (temporary) | OAuth initiation |
| `/api/auth/google` | Google OAuth URL | 302 (temporary) | OAuth initiation |
| OAuth callbacks (success) | `/` | 302 (temporary) | GitHub & Google callbacks |
| OAuth callbacks (error) | `/login?error={msg}` | 302 (temporary) | Error handling |

**Auth-guard pattern** — Pages requiring authentication redirect like:
```typescript
return Astro.redirect('/login?redirect=/course/${slug}/learn');
```
This is used in: `/feed`, `/course/[slug]/learn`, `/course/[slug]/book`, and client-side in Messages, PublicProfile, and EnrollButton components.

**Navigation context (`?via=`)** — Breadcrumbs use `?via=` query params to reflect how the user arrived at a page. The receiving page builds its breadcrumb trail conditionally based on the `via` value.

| `?via=` Value | Used On | Trail |
|---------------|---------|-------|
| `discover-communities` | `/community/[slug]` | Discover > Communities > [Name] |
| `discover-courses` | `/course/[slug]` | Discover > Courses > [Title] |
| `community-courses` | `/course/[slug]` | [Community] > Courses > [Title] (with `&cs=` and `&cn=` params) |

Without `?via=`, pages show route-based defaults (e.g., `My Communities > [Name]`).

**See:** `docs/DECISIONS.md` §5 "Breadcrumb System", `src/components/ui/Breadcrumbs.astro`

**Data-not-found pattern** — Pages redirect when resources are missing:
```
Course not found  → /discover/courses?error=not-found
Community 404     → /404
Community 403     → /discover/communities
Not enrolled      → /course/[slug]?error=not-enrolled
```
